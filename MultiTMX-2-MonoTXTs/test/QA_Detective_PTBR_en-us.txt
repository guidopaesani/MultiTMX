{}Key Terms{}
Key Terms
Here are some important key terms for you to understand in order to successfully complete this training.
Let’s begin with the Call to Action or CTA – the call to action convinces the consumer to take action.
It is what prompts a consumer taking action or beginning a conversation with you via their mobile device.
Common call to actions might be a print add, promotion, ad on the radio or TV, billboards, newspapers, and more.  the wording on the graphic that states Text NTOROX to 12345 to sign up for mobile offers & receive…is the call to action
A keyword, is simply a word for someone to text in to join a specific campaign.
In this sign, NTOROX is the keyword.
A short code is a phone number that can be shared or randomly generated, or private and personally chosen by you.
This is the number that the mobile device user will text the keyword to
The call to action should have an incentive – in other words, what’s in it for me?
What benefit does the consumer receive by texting NTOROX to 12345?
In this case, Free Snow Gloves.
Finally, it is a good idea to add Legal Copy print materials.
{}MobileConnect Templates{}
There are ten available templates in MobileConnect.
Each template is the blueprint for a campaign that you can execute in the system.
The template walks you through everything that you need to do to configure & activate each text campaign.

how data is stored when using Mobile Connect,
how to use the top 3 Mobile Connect templates and if you are an administrator,
you will learn about some of the administrative tasks you can complete within Mobile Connect.

Here is how this course will work.
There are six different lessons available to you.
Two of the lessons, the overview and data lessons are required.
They both have important information that you need to know about.
Four of the lessons are optional.
You get to choose.
If you are an administrator, you have the option of taking the administration lesson.
If you are interested in learning about the email opt-in template, you can view that lesson only, or, if you want to view all six lessons, feel free.
It's totally up to you.
This is the overview lesson.
Be sure to complete this one.
In this lesson, you will learn the definition of Mobile Connect, important key terms will be shared.
We'll talk about the templates available within Mobile Connect.
We'll share the Mobile Connect 101 course scenario and finally end with a tour of the Mobile Connect application.
What is the definition of Mobile Connect?
Mobile Connect is an application that allows you to create, send, receive and track mobile messages.
Mobile Connect can be used to create, track and manage text keywords, send SMS and MMS messages to contacts,
and it helps you automatically respond and manage incoming SMS and MMS messages, and much, much more.
You should know that you can send and receive messages using short codes within the United States,
or using a short or long code within other countries around the world.
Here are some important key terms for you to understand in order to successfully complete this training.
Let's begin with the Call To Action or CTA.
The Call To Action convinces the consumer to take action.
It's what prompts them to begin the conversation with you via their mobile device.
Common Call To Actions might be a print ad, promotion, ad on the radio or TV, billboards, newspapers and more.
The wording on the graphic that states Text “NTO Rocks” to 12345 to sign up for mobile offers and receive, is the call to action.
A key word is simply a word for someone to text in to join a specific campaign.
In this sign, “NTO Rocks” is the keyword.
A short code is a phone number that could be shared,
or randomly generated or private and personally chosen by you.
This is the number that the mobile device user will text the keyword to.
The Call To Action should have an incentive.
In other words, what's in it for me?
What benefit does a consumer receive by texting “NTO Rocks” to 12345?
In this case, free snow gloves.
Finally, it's a good idea to add legal copy to your print materials.
Available templates vary by edition of MobileConnect
There are 10 templates available to you when using Mobile Connect.
The templates are very helpful because they act as a blueprint for the different types of mobile campaigns that you're building.
Each template walks you through everything you need to do to configure and activate each mobile campaign.
Hover over the different template icons to learn more about each template type.

Data for MobileConnect is managed in Contact Builder.
If you haven’t taken the Contact Builder course, you will find it in the full course catalog on the same website you found this course.

STOP!
before we get started…it’s important for you to know that there is a course that explains the data model that is used with MobileConnect called Contact Builder.
If you are new  or existing MobileConnect user, it is important that you take the Contact Builder course to learn more about this new method of storing data.
You will find the course in the full course catalog on the same website you found this course.

Components of Data
Data is very important when using mobileconnect.
It can be used to filter lists, identify message recipients,  be used to populate messages that are relevant to the person receiving them and much much more.
There are 3 components to mobileconnect data

Let’s begin by taking a closer look at Contacts
mob-cnx.png
{}{}Contact{}:{}
{}A person who has interacted with your company via a mobile product.{}
{}Contacts{}
Your data is composed of Contacts
SUBSCRIBE
Thank you for your interest
Untitled Slide
Your data is composed of “Contacts”.
In other words, a contact is a person who has either opted-in to receive mobile communications from you or a contact is a person who has interacted with your company via a mobile product.
Simply put, it is an mobile phone number that you are sending a message to or a mobile phone number that you’ve received a message from!
In the application, you will be able to import data that consists of contacts and their personal profile information.
This data will be used in mobile message campaigns to send timely and relevant communications.
{}Where do Contacts Live?{}
All contacts live in Contact Builder for the mobile applications.
MobileConnect Contacts live in the MobileConnect System Defined Data Extensions.
Untitled Slide
So you might ask, where do contacts live?
All contacts live in Contact Builder for the mobile applications - again, if you haven’t taken the Contact Builder course, you should do so.
MobileConnect contacts live in the mobileconnect system defined data extensions that are pictured here, the MobileConnect Demographics and the MobileConnect Subscriptions data extensions.
When your account is provisioned with .
MobileConnect, these system defined data extensions are added to your account – you don’t have to do any of the work!
These contain system information that is necessary for you to successfully send mobile messages.
You also have the ability to create custom fields to collect, store, and utilize as well when sending your mobile messages.
These fields are called attributes.
data1.png
{}Attributes{}
Attributes
Attributes are a very important part of MobileConnect, let’s take a closer look
grid-bkgd-plain.png
{}{}Ted, a Contact{}{}
{}Attributes{}
Mobile Phone
Locale
First Name
Gender
Loyalty Points
Contact Key
Untitled Slide
An attribute is data about the Contact.
Mobile Phone number is a required attribute in the MobileConnect application.
So, each contact can not exist in the application without a Mobile Phone number attribute value.
Since mobile Phone number is required, it makes sense that mobile phone number is the default unique identifier within the Mobile Connect.
A unique identifier is the item that identifies a contact in the system.
Each unique ID can only exist one time and all data about an individual contact is stored on that unique identifier -- data like profile attributes, tracking results, message history, and more.
grid-bkgd-plain.png
{}Attributes{}
There are two types of Attributes.
<rpr id="48">{}System-Defined Attributes</rpr id="48" transform="close"><rpr id="47">{}

<rpr id="48">{}Custom Attributes</rpr id="48" transform="close"><rpr id="47">{}
Attributes created based on your specific need</rpr id="47" transform="close">
{}Contacts{}
Untitled Slide
There are two types of attributes in mobile connect,
system defined attributes and custom attributes
a system attribute is data about a contact that is either required or provided automatically by mobileconnect.
As a reminder, these attributes live on the 2 system generated mobileconnect data extensions that live in Contact builder.
custom attributes are those attributes that you create based on a specific need you may have.
Maybe you want to collect and utilize contact title, region, city or favorite outdoor sport in your mobile campaigns.
Totally up to you, you can build any attributes you may need.
Just remember that they are built and managed in Contact Builder.
grid-bkgd-plain.png
{}Attributes{}

It’s important to note that there are required attributes when using mobileconnect.
This means, that they must be populated for each contact on the file you are importing or the contact will not be imported to the system.
The required attributes are:
Mobile Number – the phone number of the mobile device
Locale – the country code of the mobile number, for example United States is US, UK is GB, australia is AU and brazil is BR
and if you use the subscriber key functionality in the email application, then a contact key is required for each contact in mobile connect
{}How can attributes be used?{}
Personalize the Content of the mobile message
• Personalization Strings
Target a specific segment of contacts
• Segmentation
Untitled Slide
Attributes can be used in two ways:
1.  to personalize the content of the mobile message – you can insert personalization strings in a message so the content is specific to the contact.
Relevant communications should always been your goal sending messages, whether email or mobile, and attributes help you make this happen
2.
You can also target a specific segment of contacts  using segmentation.
Attribues can be used to filter a list so that those who live in Florida, receive a message with a coupon for sandals, and those who live in Alaska receive a message with a coupon for snow shoes.
Again relevance is key to affective communications and attributes help make this happen!

Welcome to our weekly newsletter!
Two Types of Lists
A list is a collection of contacts that can be sent to in an outbound message campagin.
You can send to a list or suppress a list at the time of send.  so it’s true, a list can be a sending list or a suppression list.
While the contacts data  is stored in Contact Builder, Lists are created within the MobileConnect application.
Also, you will import contacts and their data to the lists from within mobileConnect.
Then, by default, and behind the scenes, the imported contacts and their data will be added to the mobileConnect system data extensions that live in Contact Builder.

A standard list is a list of contacts compiled as a result of one or many imports or contacts who have been manually added directly into MobileConnect.
Again, remember, contacts and their data are added in MobileConnect…but this information really lives in Contact Builder.  so think of mobileconnect as the gateway for contact information to ultimately be stored in Contact Builder.
In fact, the best way to understand this concept is to see it in action!

Filtered Lists
A filtered list is a subset of mobile contacts that live in contact builder.
The contacts can be filtered and added to a list using contact attributes that are stored on the mobileconnect system data extensions in contact builder.
But the most amazing thing is, that because the attribute data is stored in Contact builder, data from other channels can also be used in filtering lists.
Data Extensions that are created and managed in the email application are viewable within contact builder, so email attribute data can be used in conjunction with mobile attribute data to create a filtered list.
That is the power of the contact builder model!
Let’s see the creation of a filtered list in action!

Attributes
Click
Here we are in the Contact Builder application.
Remember it is accessed from the Marketing Cloud using the Data and analytics tab.
In the upper left corner, you can see that we are in the data designer area of Contact Builder
Notice the different attribute groups that are available or have been created for this account.
There are email data, mobilepush data, mobileconnect attribute groups and more.
stored within each group are corresponding data tables…some system generated and some created by users of the account
Click
In order to create an attribute to be used with the MobileConnect application, we need to click on the mobileconnect attribute group
Click the Opt Out Date list item
then, the View and Edit button that is found within the attribute group
Click the Created with Raphaël 2.1.0 diagram
Here are the two system data tables that are created by default when your account is provisioned for MobileConnect.
They are the MobileConnect Demographic table that contains attribute information like CarrierID, Channel, Contact ID, Locale and more
and the mobileconnect subscription tablel that contains keyword, mobile number, optin date and  more
You can use these attributes if you would like, some of them are required in order to have mobileconnect funtion properly, but the great thing is, you can add custom attributes to the Demographics table and use them to send relevant messages, or to create filtered lists.
Click
To create an attribute, we’ll simply hover over the top of the MobileConnect demographics data extension.  when the editing tools appear, we need to cick on the small pencil icon to be taken to the next step.
Click
once we’re in the mobileconnect demographics data extension, all we have to do is click create attribute in the upper right corner.
Type Region
Here is the box where the actual attribute creation takes place
First we need to give our attribute a name – and we’re creating the Region attribute, so that will be added here
Click
Next, we need to identify the data type – in other words, what kind of data will we  be storing for the Region attribute.
There are many options, like number, date, boolean, email address and more,
for region – we will use the text data type
Type 20
the Length value box refers to the number of characters of the data.
For us, 20 is fine – we’ll probably never have a value length that exceed 20.
Click the Create button
We could make this attribute the primary key, or the unique value of the data extension,  add a default value if needed, assign a data source, and make the attribute required.
We will just leave these values as is, and click create
Click
the region attribute now appears in the list.
It is now an attribute we can use in our MobileConnect campaigns!
List Creation
Click
to create a list, we click on the arrow next to Manage and then Contacts
Click
This is the contacts workspace.  at the top, there is an all contacts tab and a lists tab.  by default, the all contacts page is displayed. and information about our contacts is shown.  we see  contact key, mobile number, email address if we know it,  source, modified date an more
to continue creating a list, we need to click on the lists tab
Click the Create List button
and here is the lists workspace.
Once we create our list, it will be seen here in the workspace with information such as list name, contact cocunt, list type, created modified, status and more
To move forward in the list creation process, we’ll select create list
Click
In this create list dialog box, we need to specify the method by which the list will be built.
Since we are going to upload a list from a computer desktop, we’ll select the create from file radio button and then click ok to move on
Click the Browse… button
the progress bar at the top identifies that there there are 4 steps in the import contacts process.
In step one is to upload a file, step two, a short code and keyword are selected, step 3 is the configure mapping stage, and step 4 is where the process is reviewed and saved.
we are in step one of the process.
It’s here, that the file to upload is selected.
By clicking Browse, we will be taken to the desktop where we can choose the appropriate file to upload.
In our case, we will upload the NTOcontacts.csv file.
Double-Click
here it is, the NTO Contacts file, we will select the file
Click
and then click the I agree checkbox to ensure that the application knows that the individuals on the list have given us permission to send them mobile messages
Click
here we see the file upload is complete
Click the text box
Now we’ve moved onto step 2 of the process.
We need to choose a short code and keyword that we want to associate with the new contacts.
we’ll  choose the short code 59545 and keyword NTO Daily
Click
In step 3, the mapping is configured.
In othere words, it here  hat the column headers s found on the spreadsheet will be mapped , to the appropriate attributes that live on the mobileconnect data extensions housed within contact builder
there are three options – map by header row, by ordinal or manually.  b ecause the file we are importing has column headers that are similar to the attribute names in the system, we will choose to map manually
Click
On the left, we can see the headers that were found on the NTOContacts file we are importing.  and on the right, we see the attributes that are available or that have been created in the contact builder.
Using the drop down arrows, we can map the appropriate spreadsheet headers to attributes within contact builder.
Click
Now, we can see that all of the columns on the spreadsheet are mapped appropriately to the attributes in the system.
Mobile number to mobile number
Locale is mapped to locale
contact key to contact key
even the region column is mapped to the custom attribute we created region
so now, step 3 is complete
Click the Save & Build button
in step 4, we will review the import information and then choose save and build to move on
Click
in the save as dialog box, we’ll give our list a name – the name for this list is Daily Deals mobile message
and then we’ll make sure the correct list format is selected.
In this case, the standard format radio button is what we’ll choose and then we’ll click save to move on
Click
Here is the list information – there are 5 rows of data
we can look at the individual contacts by clicking ont he contacts tab
Click the MobileConnect Lists link
here are the records -
we can see the data that we have on the contacts.  like mobile number source modified date and channel
to view the lists workspace, simply click the Mobileconnect lists link in the upper left corner
Click
and here is the daily deals mobile message list…it is now a list that we can send mobile messages to!
Filtered List
Click
to create a filtered list, we will click manage on the overview page
Click
Then we’ll select the Lists tab to be taken to the lists workspace
Click the Create List button
Next, we’ll select Create list in the upper right corner
Click
we’ll make sure the Filtered List radio button is selected in the create list dialog box…and it is,
Click the text box
We need to choose a starting population – or source list for our filt4ered list.
We will choose all m obile contacts, but we could choose any other lists that have been created in the account as the source if we wanted to
Click
On the left side of the screen we see all of the tables of attributes that are available for use to use when creating a filtered list.
Notice that we could use the exacttarget system data extension, the email data, mobileconnect data to name a few.
It’s here the power of contact builder is present.
Click the text box
If we wanted to use data that is stored in data extensions within the email application, and is viewable in Contact Builder to create our filtered list…we could.
So it’s true…through contact builder we have the ability to use cross channel data when creating a filtered list
In fact, here are all of the attributes available to us when creating this specific filtered list…these attributes are from the email application!
So we could drag gender, language, DOB, Address 1, city, state and zip over to the canvas to be used in our filtereing rules if we wanted.
That isn’t our use case today, but it’s important for you to know that you have that capability!
Click the text box
Our use case requires us to use the region attribute data that has been created in contact builder.  we want to create a filtered list that includes all contacts who live in the north region.
And because we imported a list of new contacts to a list in mobileconnect, that attribute data in contact builder now contains data on our contacts.
Remember, mobileconnect is the gateway for contact data to get to contact builder?
so we’ll access the mobileconnect demographics data extionsion by clicking here
Click and drag
Here is the region attribute – we’ll simply click and drag it to the canvas.
So the attribute that we want to use for the filtered list is identified
Click
and now the the rule appears – the region attributes appears to the left, the operator is in the middle
Click
when we click on the arrow the available operators appear.  for this scenario, equal is the correct operator
Click the Save & Build button
in the value box on the right, we’ll add the value we are looking for – in this case the region value is north
so the rules states:
If the region is equal to North, then add the contact to this filtered list
now it’s true this is a very simple scenario – you can see that with all of the different attributes available to you on the left of the screen- you could create very complex rules to ensure you are targeting your contacts the way you want.  you have a lot of flexibility!
TO move on…we’ll click the save and build button
Click the Save button
The list name is North Region List and The format will be standard – and we’ll click save to move on
Click
There are two records that fit the criteria – we could click on the contacts tab if we wanted to look at the individual records
Click
Maybe we aren’t happy with the number of contacts who meet the criteria…if that’s the case, we have the ability to change our criteria or rules to arrive at the number we are looking for – to do that, we would simply click the edit button to be taken back to the rules canvas
Click
and finally, we can see that our North Region List has been created and is ready to be sent mobile messages.
Now remember, we created a simply filter rule – you can be as complex as you want!
The sky is the limit!

Welcome to the Mobile Connect 101 data lesson.
In this lesson, we will take a close look at how data is managed when using Mobile Connect.
Before we get started, it's important for you to know that there is a course that explains the data model that is used with Mobile Connect called Contact Builder.
If you are a new or existing Mobile Connect user, it's important that you take the Contact Builder course to learn about this method of storing data.
You will find the course in the full course catalog on the same website you found this course.
Here's what you will learn in this data lesson, how data works with Mobile Connect, the definition of contacts and where they live,
what an attribute is and how to create, edit, and use them, what a list is and how to filter one.
Let's get started.
Data is very important when using Mobile Connect.
It can be used to filter lists, identify message recipients,
be used to populate messages that are relevant to the person receiving them, and much, much more.
There are three components to Mobile Connect data: contacts, attributes, and lists.
Let's begin by taking a closer look at Contacts.
Your data is composed of contacts.
In other words, a contact is a person who is either opted in to receive mobile communications from you,
or a contact is a person who has interacted with your company via a mobile product.
Simply put, it's a mobile phone number that you are sending a message to
or a mobile phone number that you've received a message from.
In the application you will be able to import data that consists of contacts and their personal profile information.
This data will be used in mobile message campaigns to send timely and relevant communications.
You might ask, where do contacts live?
All contacts live in Contact Builder for the mobile applications.
Again, if you haven't taken the Contact Builder course you should.
Mobile Connect contacts live in the Mobile Connect system-defined data extensions that are pictured here:
the Mobile Connect demographics, and the mobile subscriptions data extensions.
When your account is provisioned with Mobile Connect these system-defined data extensions are added to your account.
You don't have to do any of the work.
These contain system information that is necessary for you to successfully send mobile messages.
These fields are called attributes.
Attributes are a very important part of Mobile Connect.
Let's take a closer look.
An attribute is data about the contact.
Mobile phone number is a required attribute in the Mobile Connect application,
so each contact cannot exist in the application without a mobile phone number attribute value.
Since mobile phone number is required, it makes sense that mobile number is the default unique identifier within the Mobile Connect application.
A unique identifier is the item that identifies a contact in the system.
Each unique ID can only exist one time and all data about an individual contact is stored on that unique identifier.
Data like profile attributes, tracking results, message history, and more.
There are two types of attributes in Mobile Connect: system-defined attributes and custom attributes.
A system-defined attribute is data about a contact that is either required or provided automatically by Mobile Connect.
As a reminder, these attributes live on the two-system generated Mobile Connect data extensions that live in Contact Builder.
Custom attributes are those attributes that you create based on a specific need you may have.
Maybe you want to collect and utilize contact title, region, city, or favorite outdoor sport in your mobile campaigns.
It's totally up to you.
You can build any attributes you may need.
Just remember that they are built and managed in Contact Builder.
It's important to note that there are required attributes when using Mobile Connect.
This means that they must be populated for each contact in the file that you're importing or the contact will not be imported to the system.
The required attributes are mobile number, the phone number of the mobile device, and locale.
The country code of the mobile number, for example, United States is US
and if you use a subscriber key functionality in the email application,
then a contact key is required for each contact in Mobile Connect.
Attributes can be used in two ways.
To personalize the content of the mobile message,
you can insert personalization strings in a message so the content is specific to the contact.
Relevant communication should always be your goal when sending messages, whether email or mobile,
and attributes help you make this happen.
You can also target a specific segment of contacts using segmentation.
Attributes can be used to filter a list, so that those who live in Florida receive a message with a coupon for sandals,
and those who live in Alaska receive a message with a coupon for snowshoes.
Again, relevance is key to effective communications, and attributes help make this happen.
Here is our Northern Trail Outfitters scenario.
Northern Trail Outfitters wants to send relevant mobile communications to their customers.
They want to store region information for their customers so they can send region-specific mobile messages to them.
A region attribute will be created in Contact Builder for use within Mobile Connect.
The following simulation will walk you through how to create an attribute in Contact Builder.
Click the button to begin.
Lists are created and contacts are imported to lists within Mobile Connect.
A list is a collection of contacts that can be sent to in an outbound message campaign.
You can send to a list or suppress a list at the time of send,
so it's true, a list can be a sending list or a suppression list.
While the contact's data is stored in Contact Builder,
lists are created within the Mobile Connect application.
Also, you will import contacts and their data to the list from within Mobile Connect,
then by default, and behind the scenes, the imported contacts and their data will be added to the Mobile Connect system data extensions that live in Contact Builder.
A standard list is a list of contacts compiled as a result of one or many imports or contacts who have been manually added directly into Mobile Connect.
Again, remember contacts and their data are added in Mobile Connect,
but this information really lives in Contact Builder.
Think of Mobile Connect as the gateway for contact information to ultimately be stored in Contact Builder.
In fact, the best way to understand this concept is to see it in action.
Here is the Northern Trail Outfitters scenario.
Northern Trail Outfitters wants to send a daily deal text message to customers who've opted in to receive the daily messages.
They will import new data each day and send the daily messages to a standard list.
A text message with the daily deal will be sent each day at 9:00.
The following simulation will walk you through how to create a list and import contacts to the list in Mobile Connect.
Click the button to begin.
A filtered list is a subset of mobile contacts that live in Contact Builder.
The contacts can be filtered and added to a list,
using contact attributes that are stored In the Mobile Connect System Data Extensions and Contact Builder.
The most amazing thing is, that because of the attribute data is stored in Contact Builder,
data from other channels can also be used in filtering lists.
Data extensions that are created and managed in the email application are viewable within Contact Builder, for example.
Email attribute data can be used in conjunction with mobile attribute data to create a filtered list.
That is the power of the Contact Builder model.
Let's see the creation of a filtered list in action.
Here is the Northern Trail Outfitters scenario.
Northern Trail Outfitters wants to send mobile coupons to customers based on their region.
They will use a region mobile attribute data that is stored in Contact Builder to create a filtered list.
A text message with a coupon will be sent to customers who match the criteria and have been added to the filtered list.
The following simulation will walk you through how to create a filtered list.
Click the button to begin.
Congratulations.
You have completed the Mobile Connect 101 data lesson.
Now it's time for you to choose your lessons.
It would be a great idea to view each one, but you don't have to.
Simply close out of this lesson and choose the next one that you'd like to take.
Here we are in the Contact Builder application.
In the upper left corner you can see that we are in the data designer area of Contact Builder.
Notice the different attribute groups that are available, or those that have been created for this account.
There are email data, mobile push data, Mobile Connect attribute groups, and more.
Stored within each group are corresponding data tables, some system generated and some created by users of the account.
In order to create an attribute to be used with the Mobile Connect application,
we need to click on the Mobile Connect attribute group.
Next we'll click the View and Edit button that is found within the attribute group.
Here are the two system data tables that are created by default when your account is provisioned for Mobile Connect.
They are the Mobile Connect demographic table, which contains information like carrier ID, channel, contact ID, locale, and more,
and the Mobile Connect subscriptions table that contains keyword, mobile number, opt-in date, and more.
You can use these attributes if you would like.
Some of them are required in order to have Mobile Connect function properly but the great thing is you can add custom attributes to the demographics table
and use them to send relevant messages or to create filtered lists.
To create an attribute, we'll simply hover over the top of the Mobile Connect demographics data extension,
and when the editing tools appear, we need to click on the small pencil icon to be taken to the next step.
Once we're in the Mobile Connect demographics data extension, all we have to do is click Create Attribute in the upper right corner.
Here is the box where the actual attribute creation takes place.
First, we need to give our attribute a name, and we're creating the region attribute, so that will be added here.
Next, we need to identify the data type.
In other words, what kind of data will we be storing for the region attribute.
There are many options like number, date, Boolean, email address, and more.
For region, we will use the text data type.
The length value box refers to the number of characters of the data.
For us, twenty is fine.
We'll probably never have a value length that exceeds twenty for the region attribute.
We could make this attribute the primary key or the unique value of the data extension, add a default value if needed, assign a data source or make the attribute required if we wanted.
For now we'll just leave these values as is and click Create.
Here it is.
The region attribute can now be used in our Mobile Connect campaigns.
That's how you create an attribute in Contact Builder for use within Mobile Connect.
To begin the list creation process we'll simply click on the arrow next to Manage and then choose Contacts.
This is the contacts workspace.
At the top, there is an All Contacts tab and a List tab.
By default, the All Contacts page is displayed and information about our contacts is shown.
We can see contact key, mobile number, email address if we know it, source, modified date, and more.
To continue creating a list, we need to click on the List tab.
Here is the List workspace.
Once we create our list, it will be seen here in the workspace, with information such as list name, contact count, list type, created, modified, status, and more.
To move forward in the list creation process, we'll select Create List.
In this Create List dialogue box we need to specify the method by which the list will be built.
Since we're going to upload a list from a computer desktop, we'll select the Create From File radio button, and then click OK to move on.
The progress bar at the top identifies that there are four steps in the import process.
Step one is where a file is uploaded.
Step two, a short code and keyword are selected.
In step three, the mapping is configured.
In step four, this is where the process is reviewed and saved.
We're in step one of the process.
It's here that the file to upload is selected.
By clicking Browse, we will be taken to the desktop where we can choose the appropriate file to upload.
In our case, we will upload the NTO contacts.csv file.
And here it is.
The NTO contacts file.
We'll select the file by clicking on it.
Next, we'll click the I Agree checkbox to ensure that the application knows that the individuals on the list have given us permission to send them mobile messages.
Here, we can see that the file upload is complete.
Now we've moved on to step two of the process.
We need to choose a short code and keyword that we want to associate with the new contacts.
We'll choose a short code 59545, and keyword NTO daily.
In step 3 the mapping is configured.
In other words, it's here that the column headers found on the spreadsheet will be mapped to the appropriate attributes that live on the Mobile Connect data extensions housed within Contact Builder.
There are 3 options, map by header row, by ordinal, or manually.
Because the file we're importing has column headers that are similar to the attribute names in the system, we will choose to map manually.
On the left, we can see the headers that were found on the NTO contacts file we're importing.
On the right, we see the attributes that are available or that have been created in Contact Builder.
Using the drop-down arrows, we can map the appropriate spreadsheet headers to attributes within Contact Builder.
Now, we can see that all the columns on the spreadsheet are mapped appropriately to the attributes in the system.
Mobile number to mobile number.
Locale is mapped to locale.
Contact key to contact key.
Even the region column is mapped to the custom attribute we created, region.
Now, step three is complete.
In step 4, we will review the import information and then choose Save and Build to move on.
In the Save As dialogue box we'll give our list a name.
The name for this list is Daily Deals Mobile Message.
Then we'll make sure the correct list format is selected.
In this case the Standard Format radio button is what we'll choose, and then we'll click Save to move on.
Here is the list information or list properties for the list we've just created.
We can see that there are 5 rows of data, and we can look at the individual contacts by clicking on the Contacts tab.
Here are the records.
We can see the data that we have on the contacts, like mobile number, source, modified date and channel,
and to view the list workspace, we simply click the Mobile Connect list link in the upper left corner.
And here is the daily deals mobile message list.
It is now a list that we can send mobile messages to, and that's how you create a list within Mobile Connect.
To create a filtered list, we will click Manage on the overview page.
Then we'll select the List tab to be taken to the list workspace.
Next, we'll select Create List in the upper right corner.
Since we're creating a filtered list, we need to make sure that the Filtered List radio button is selected in the Create List dialog box.
Here we need to choose a starting population, or a source list, for our filtered list.
We will choose All Mobile Contacts, but we could choose any other list that has been created in the account as a source, if we wanted to.
On the left side of the screen we see all of tables of attributes that are available for us to use when creating a filtered list.
Notice that we could use the exact target system data extension, the email data extension, Mobile Connect data extensions, to name a few.
It's here the power of Contact Builder is present.
If we wanted to use data that is stored in data extensions within the email application and is viewable in Contact Builder to create our filtered list we could.
So, it's true, through Contact Builder we have the ability to use cross-channel data when creating a filtered list.
In fact, here are all the attributes available to us when creating this specific filtered list.
These attributes are from the email application.
So, we could drag gender, language, date of birth, address 1, city, state, and zip over to the canvas to be used in our filtering rules if we wanted.
That's not our use case today but it is important for you to know that you do have that capability.
Our use case requires us to use region attribute data that has been created in Contact Builder.
We want to create a filtered list that includes all contacts who live in the north region.
Because we imported a list of new contacts to a list in Mobile Connect, that attribute data in Contact Builder now contains data on our contacts.
Remember, Mobile Connect is a gateway for contact data to get to Contact Builder, so we'll access the Mobile Connect demographics data extension by clicking here.
Here is the region attribute.
We'll simply click and drag it to the canvas, so the attribute that we want to use for the filtered list is identified.
And now the rule appears.
The region attribute appears to the left, the operator is in the middle.
When we click on the arrow, the available operators appear.
For this scenario, equal is the correct operator.
In the value box on the right, we'll add the value we're looking for.
In this case, the region value is north.
The rule states, "If the region is equal to north, then add the contact to this filtered list."
Now it's true that this is a very simple scenario.
You can see that all of the different attributes available to you on the left of the screen could really be used to create very complex rules.
Just to make sure that you're targeting your contacts the way you want, you really do have a lot of flexibility.
To move on, we'll click the Save and Build button.
The list name is north region list and the format will be standard.
Then we'll click Save to move on.
There are two records that fit the criteria.
We could click on the Contacts tab if we wanted to look at the individual records.
Maybe we aren't happy with the number of contacts who meet the criteria.
If that's the case, we have the ability to change our criteria or rules to arrive at the number we're looking for.
To do that we would simply click the Edit button to be taken back to the rules canvas.
Finally we can see that our north region list has been created and is ready to be sent mobile messages.

Customer Service
Maybe your goal is to send messages that are dynamic or unique in nature.
Here is a good example of dynamic messages using text response.
In this case, NTO would like to help their customers quickly and easily find the holiday hours of the store  location nearest them.
Customers are encouraged to text in the Keyword Holiday and their zip code to 12345.  t
The corresponding text response message has AMPScript in the body of the message – the Marketing Cloud’s scripting language
When a response is sent to a customer, the ampscript activates and looks at the databasee that contains the zip code information.
The appropriate store location and holiday hours are then added to the text response message.

So here’s how it works,
The user creates keywords in mobileconnect and designs a campaign or CTA to display their message
Customers see the CTA message and receive a response sms message by texting the keyword to the short code.
In this case, customers will text ntocoupons to receive a coupon to be used at an NTO store

Three Step Process
There are 3 steps to creating a Text Response campaign in the MobileConnect application

Next, the content is defined.
In other words, you identify the keyword and short code used to power the message, as well as create the actual message itself.
Finally, the message is scheduled and activited so it is a live campaign.
That’s it.

Click
We’ll simply click create message in the upper right corner to create the text response campaign
Click
Here is step 1 – where we choose a template –
Now you’ll notice that only 7 templates appear here, not all 10.
This may be the case for you as well, if you would like to have access to the other 3 templates, simply talk to your account representative.
All 10 templates do not appear by default.
we need to select the text response template
Click and drag
We’ve complete step 1
now for step 2, which is where we define the content
First, the message needs to be given a name, and in this case, In-Store 10% off coupon code is the message name
Next, we need to select the appropriate short or long code
It is possible that your mobileconnect account has more than one code provisioned.
Simply click on the arrow to show all available short or long codes
We only have one short code available, so we’ll choose it – short code 59545
Next, we need to choose the appropriate keyword to power this campaign.
It’s nice to know that you have the ability to create a new keyword right as you are building a campaign.
Simply choose the create keyword radio button and type in the desired keyword and click create.
If the keyword is already in use, you will be told it isn’t available, and you can try a different keyword.
For this message,NTOCOUPON is the keyword that will drive this campaign
If we wanted to continue the conversation without requiring the mobile device user to keep on texting in keywords, we could use the next keyword functionality.
That’s not our scenario today, so we will move to the call to action section of the of this page.
This area is totally optional.
It is only for users of the application and helps describe the corresponding call to action that will prompt individuals to text the keyword to the short code.
In our case, we are going to type the text of the print materials found in our NTO stores
Click and drag
Our signs read – for 10%off today’s purchase, text ntocoupon to 59545, so we’ve added that information here
Under the messages header we find the Response MEssage box.
It’s here we will type the message that will be sent
in the message box, we have the ability to insert content – like stored headers, footers, or personalization strings that will insert attributes values into the message
we can also shorten a URL if we are adding one to our message because the characters in a url will count toward our total message character count with 160 characters being the maximum
We can also abbreviate common words to use fewer characters too
you’ll see the number of characters used in the lower left corner
and…a preview of the message as you type it can be seen to the right
Click
Let’s just add a simple static coupon code message to this campaign
we’ll add ”Use the code NTO10PERCENT for 10% off your purchase today to the message boxOnce it’s complete, and if we like the way it looks in the preview pane, we simply click ok to move on
Click the text box
Here is the default error message…it states ”Sorry there was an error.
Please try again.”
We can keep the default error message or change it if we want.
We’ll just keep the default message
If we want to associate this message to a campaign that we are managing in the Marketing Cloud we can do that…or we can even create a new campaign here as well
And we can perform a test by clickin on the Perform test button – just to make sure that we’ve set everything up correctly in this template
When we’re ready, we’ll click next in the upper right corner
Click
Here is the third and final step
At the top there is a summary section which provides summary information about the message
Like message name, template used, short code and keyword
There is also an Activiation area which is where the message can be activated immedately, or it can be scheduled for the future
Let’s click the future/recurring button
Click
a calendar appears that allows us to identify the start and end date of the send as well time zone of the send
Click the Schedule button
when we’re ready, we’ll simply click schedule to activate the message
Click the Confirm button
and then confirm to complete the process
Click
and finally, we can see that this message is now live and ready to go!
The NTOCOUPON text response campaign is set up and running!
And that’s how you create a text response campaign in mobileconnect

Welcome to the Mobile Connect 101 text response lesson.
Hopefully, you've taken the overview and data lessons.
If not, you should.
They share valuable information that will help you during this text response lesson.
Here is what you will learn: the definition of a text response message, typical use cases for a text response campaign will be shared, and you'll also learn how to create a text response message.
Let's get started.
A text response template allows you to create an automatic response to an inbound SMS message.
Text response campaigns are a perfect way for you to bring offline customers online.
They encourage them to text a keyword to a short code via a call to action that is typically offline like signage in a store, on a billboard, or an ad on the radio.
You can respond with a message that includes a coupon, QR code, or up-to-the-minute information and much, much more.
Here is a great use case, coupons via text response.
The call to action is seen on the left.
This might be an in-store promotion, for example.
While shopping, customers are encouraged to text NTO to 12345 to get 10% off of any purchase they're going to make today.
The response message they receive includes the 10% off coupon code.
This is another great example of the way you can use text response.
NTO wants to customers who are interested in getting information about their returns and exchange policies quickly and easily.
With signage around the store, customers can text Returns to 12345 and in real time they receive a text message with NTO's return and exchange policies.
Maybe your goal is to send messages that are dynamic or unique in nature.
Here is a good example of dynamic messages using text response.
In this case, NTO would like to help their customers quickly and easily find the holiday hours of the store location nearest them.
Customers are encouraged to text in the keyword "Holiday" and their ZIP code to 12345.
The corresponding text response message has amp script in the body of the message; the marketing cloud scripting language.
When a response is sent to a customer, the amp script activates and looks at the database that contains the ZIP code information.
The appropriate store location and holiday hours are then added to the text response message.
Here's how it works.
The user creates keywords in Mobile Connect and designs a campaign or CTA to display their message.
Customers see the CTA message and receive a response SMS message by texting the keyword to the short code.
In this case, customers will text “NTO coupons” to receive a coupon to be used at an NTO store.
There are three steps to creating a text response campaign in the Mobile Connect application.
In step one, you choose the appropriate template, in this case, the text response template.
Next, the content is defined.
In other words, you identify the keyword and short code used to power the message, as well as create the actual message itself.
Finally, the message is scheduled and activated, so it is a live campaign.
That's it.
Here is the NTO text response scenario.
Northern Trail Outfitters wants to offer mobile coupons to customers as they shop in brick and mortar stores.
They want to use various print CTAs throughout the store.
Employees will also be trained to encourage customers to text in the key word to the short code to receive the coupon.
A text message with the coupon code will be sent to customers.
The following simulation will walk you through the steps necessary to create a text response message.
Click the button to begin.
Congratulations.
You have completed the Mobile Connect 101 text response lesson.
Go ahead and close this lesson and then choose the next one you'd like to take.
We'll simply click Create Message in the upper right corner to create the text response campaign.
Here is step one where we choose a template.
Now you'll notice that only 7 templates appear here, not all 10.
This may be the case for you as well.
If you would like to have access to the other 3 templates, simply talk to your account representative.

We've completed Step 1.
Now for Step 2, which is where we define the content.
First, the message needs to be given a name, and in this case "in-store 10% off coupon code" is the message name.
Next, we need to select the appropriate short or long code.
Now, it's possible that your Mobile Connect account has more than one code provision.
Simply click on the arrow to show all available short or long codes.
We only have one short code available, so we'll choose it.
Short code 59545.
Next, we need to choose the appropriate keyword to power this campaign.
It's nice to know that you have the ability to create a new keyword right as you're building a campaign.
Simply choose the Create Keyword radio button and type in the desired keyword and click Create.
If the keyword is already in use, you will be told it's not available, and you should then try a different keyword.
For this message, "NTO coupon" is the keyword that will drive this campaign.
If we wanted to continue the conversation without requiring the mobile device user to keep on texting in keywords, we could use the next keyword functionality.
That's not our scenario today, so we will move to the Call To Action section of this page.
This area is totally optional.

In our case, we're going to type the text of the print materials found in our NTO stores.
Our signage reads, "For today's 10% off purchase, text NTO Coupon to 59545," so we've added that information here.
Under the messages header, we find the response message box.
It's here we will type the message that will be sent.
In the message box, we have the ability to insert content like stored headers, footers, or personalization strings that will insert attribute values into the message.
We can also shorten a URL, if we're adding one to our message, because the characters in a URL will count toward our total message character count, with 160 characters being the maximum.

You'll see the number of characters used in the lower left corner, and a preview of message as you type it, can be seen on the right.
You can see that we've added a simple static coupon code message to this campaign.
It reads, "Use the code NTO10% for 10% off your purchase today."
Once it's complete, and if we like the way it looks in the preview pane, we simply click OK to move on.
Now here is the default error message.
It states, "Sorry there was an error.
Please try again."
We can keep the default error message or change it if we want.
We'll just keep this message.
If we want to associate this message to a campaign that we're managing in the marketing cloud, we can do that, or we can even create a new campaign here as well.
We can perform a test by clicking on the Perform Test button just to make sure that we've set everything up correctly in this template.
When we're ready, we'll click Next in the upper right corner.
Here is the third and final step.
At the top, there is a summary section, which provides summary information about the message, like message name, template used, short code and keyword.
There is also an activation area, which is where the message can be activated immediately or it can be scheduled for the future.
Let's click the Future Recurring button.
A calendar appears that allows us to identify the start and end date of the send, as well as the time zone of the send.
When we're ready we'll simply click Schedule to activate the message.
Then confirm to complete the process.
Finally, we can see that this message is now live and ready to go.
The NTO coupon text response campaign is set up and running.
That's how you create a text response campaign in Mobile Connect.

Email Opt-in Use Case
Email Opt-in Use Case
Here is a great example of how email opt in can be used
NTO has instore signage that encourages their customers to text NTO a space and their email address to 12345 to be added to an email list.
The emails that follow might contain coupons, special information that is only sent to email subscribers, info about special events at brick and mortar stores and more!
Receives the text and sends confirmation SMS and email
Contact texts in keyword and email address to short code
Text {}Signmeup {}and your email address to
{}88769{}
To receive our Monthly Newsletter!
Text {}Signmeup {}and your email address to
To receive our Monthly Newsletter!
Untitled Slide
So here’s how an email opt in template works!
The user creates the cta giving the customer the information they need to be added to an email list – in this case we see a sign that says text signmeup and your email address to 88769 to receive our monthly newsletter
the contact texts in the keyword and the email address to the short code
once the mobilcconnect application receives the text, a confirmation sms message will be sent to the mobile device user letting them know that they’ve been added to the list and that an email will follow shortly!
Finally, when it’s time, the monthly newsletter will be sent to them!
{}Four Step Process{}
{}v{}
{}Select the Email Opt-In Template{}
{}Define Content{}
{}Select Audience{}
{}Schedule and Activate{}
Four Step Process
There are 4 steps to creating an email opt-in  campaign in the MobileConnect application
In step one, you choose the appropriate template, in this case, the email opt in template
Next, the content is defined.
In other words, you identify the keyword and short code used to power the message, as well as create the actual message itself.
the third step is necessary if the call to action originates from an outbound sms message.
If the call to action is a sign in a store, for example, then step 3 is not necessary and is skipped.
<rpr id="57">Finally, the message is scheduled and activited so it is a live campaign.

Congratulations
Congratulations, you have completed the mobileconnect 101 email opt in lesson!
Go ahead and close this lesson and then choose the next lesson you would like to take
View Scene
Click
Once we’ve accessed  the mobileconnect application, We’ll simply click create message in the upper right corner to begin the creation the email opt-in  campaign
Click
Here is step 1 – where we will choose a template for this campaign
Now you’ll notice that only 7 templates appear here, not all 10.
All 10 templates do not appear by default.
we need to select the email opt-in  template
Type Monthly Newsletter List
Now we’re onto step two of the process and this message will be named monthly newsletter list so we’ll add that here
Click
Next, we need to select the appropriate short or long code – We only have one short code available, so we’ll choose it – short code 59545
Click
Next, we need to choose the appropriate keyword to power this campaign.
You can create a new keyword or choose an existing one – the dropdown displays the available keywords, we’ll choose NTONEWS
Click
If we wanted to continue the conversation without requiring the mobile device user to keep on texting in keywords, we could use the next keyword functionality.
That’s not our scenario today, so we will move to the call to action section of the of this page.
This is where we identify what type of call to action will be associated with this email opt-in campaign.
If we chose the Outbound option, then there would be 4 steps to creating the email opt-in campain.
That’s because we would need to create the outbound sms message,  as well as the list we would send the message to.
The message sent would include the CTA or action we want the mobile device user to take…to add themselves to our monthly newsletter list.
But since our CTA is an external source, signs in our store, we will choose that option and the number of steps changes to 3.
In our case, we are going to Select the external source as the call to action and we’ll add the CTA info to the value box
Scroll the mouse wheel
Our CTA message is:
Text NTONEWS and your email address to short code 59545 to be added to our monthly newsletter list.
In the Messages header and Response message area  we see that we could insert content or personalization if we wanted, shorten a URL if there is one in the message, or abbreviate the text.
Remember, the maximum character count for a text message is 160 characters  You’ll see the number of characters used in the lower left corner
and a  preview of the message as you type it can be seen to the right
You can see we’ve  added a simple static message to this campaign  It says: thanks for your interest!
You’ve been added to the monthly newsletter list.
An email will follow shortly
The default error message can be changed if needed, but we’ll just keep it as is because it communicates information that we want to be sent if there is an error
Now we’ll scroll down to complete further information
Click
We need to identify which list in the email application the individuals who opt-in with this keyword should be added to.
You see that we can create a list on the fly as we create this message, or we can select a list that is already built in the email application.
That’s our use case today, we’ll click on select a list.
It’s important to point out that the individuals will be added to a list in the email application - so…this is where you are seeing cross channel functionality in play – we’re using the mobile channel to add subscribers to an email list!
Click
So here are the available lists found in the my lists folder in the email application.
we’ll add the new contacts to the the monthly newsletter list
Click the Next button
we could add a campaing association or create a new campaign if we wanted, but instead we’ll choose Next to continue
Click
At the top there is a summary section which provides summary information about the message
There is also an Activiation area which is where the message can be activated immedately, or it can be scheduled for the future
Let’s choose immediately
Click the Schedule button
and then click schedule in the upper right corner
Click
and  confirm to complete the process
Click
and finally, we can see that this message is now live and ready to go!
The NTONEWS Email Opt-In campaign is set up and running!
And that’s how you create an email opt-in campaign in mobileconnect

Now we see that this message is now live and ready to go, the NTO News email opt-in campaign is set up and running and that's how you create an email opt-in campaign in Mobile Connect.
Welcome to the Mobile Connect 101 email opt-in lesson.
Hopefully, you've taken the overview and data lessons.
If not, you should.
They share valuable information that will help you during this email opt-in lesson.
Here is what you will learn: the definition of an email opt-in message,
typical use cases for an email opt-in campaign will be shared, and you'll also learn how to create an email opt-in message.
Let's get started.
The email opt-in template allows you to invite people to subscribe to your email messages via SMS.
An email opt-in campaign is used to bring offline customers online by encouraging an individual to text the keyword and their email address to a short code to sign up for emails such as newsletters, coupons, et cetera.
It's a perfect way for you to set up a simple campaign that once activated, will be a quick and easy way for your customers to opt in to receive your email communications.
It's easy for you to set it and forget it.
You create the campaign and then you sit back and watch your email list grow.
Here is a great example of how email opt-in can be used.
NTO has in-store signage that encourages their customers to text NTO, a space and their email address to 12345 to be added to an email list.
The emails that might follow could contain coupons, special information that is only sent to email subscribers, information about special events at brick and mortar stores and much, much more.
So, here's how an email opt-in template works.
The user creates the CTA giving the customer the information they need to be added to an email list.
In this case, we see a sign that says Text “sign me up and your email address to 88769 to receive our monthly newsletter”.
The contact texts in the keyword and their email address to the short code.
Once the Mobile Connect application receives the text a confirmation SMS message will be sent to the mobile device user letting them know that they've been added to the list and then an email will follow shortly.
Finally, when it's time, the monthly newsletter will be sent to them.
There are four steps to creating an email opt-in campaign in the Mobile Connect application{}.{}
In step one, you choose the appropriate template, in this case, the email opt-in template.
Next the content is defined.
In other words, you identify the key word and short code used to power the message as well as create the actual message itself.

A new contact has opted-in to receive sms message from NTO.
The outbound message reads:

It is a good idea to send a welcome message that confirms that the opt-in has taken place.
That they know they will be receiving messages from you.
Why not add message frequency information, the types of messages they will receive, as well as give them the opportunity to get help or to stop receiving messages.

Our Use Case
So here is how the outbound message works.
The mobileconnect user  has CTAs online and offline requesting their customers to opt-in to receive outbound messages, in his case daily deals.
The mobile device user texts in the appropriate keyword, to opt-in to receive the daily outbound sms message.
A message is created in MobileConnect,  and is scheduled to be sent each day to those who have opted-in.
Data is updated each day so that the message goes to the most-up-to date list of opted-in contacts.
{}Six Step Process{}
{}v{}
{}Create an Attribute{}
{}Create a Keyword{}
{}Create a List{}
{}Import to a List{}
{}Create Outbound Message{}
{}Send Outbound Message{}
Prepare Your File
There are six steps necessary to creating an outbound message.
Step one – create an attribute.
You learned how to create an attribute in the data lesson in this course.
If you want to personalize the messages you are going to send to contacts, you need to first create an attribute.
Next, Create a Keyword,  Administrators can create keywords for you, this is covered in the administration lesson.
Or you can create a keyword during the outbound message creation process.
Step 3 and 4 create a list and import to a list – you learned how to do this during the data lesson.
It makes sense that you would need a list to send an outbound message to..right?
Once those 4 steps are complete, it’s time to move onto step 5, which is when you will create the outbound message
and finally in step 6, you send the message
we’ll complete steps 5 and 6 in this lesson

Click
We’ll simply click create message in the upper right corner to create the outbound message
Click
Here is step 1 – we need to select the outbound template
Click
Now we’re onto step two of the process and the message name is Daily Deal Message
Next, we need to select the appropriate short or long code – We only have one short code available, so we’ll choose it – short code 59545
and we’ll skip the Next Keyword
Under the Messages heading, we identify the send method.
Will it be scheduled – meaning the message will be sent immediately or at the date and time we determine in the last step of the message creation process
API triggered – the message will be sent via an api call
Automation – the message will be created in such a way that it can be Automated using Automation Studio – that’s our use case today – this is the perfect example of an outbound message that we would want to automate – it goes out everyday at the same time, why not place it in an automate it?
or it could be sent as an interaction for use with Journey Builder
we’ll choose the automation send method
Click the text box
The message will start with:
Today’s Daily Deals
We want to add a dynamic element to our message – the deals change daily.
Each day we do an import of new opt-in contacts, and new daily deal product and price data as well.
The data is stored as attributes in Contact Builder.
We only want to create this message once, so we can add personalization strings to the message so at the time of send, the appropriate and most up-to-date product and price info is added to the message.
In other words, each day the daily deal changes, and we have to import the data before the message is sent.
This way, the correct message is sent!
To add the attribute values, we will click on insert content
Click
first, we want to add the personalization string for Daily Deal Product, so we’ll choose that attribute and we can see that the personalization string %%Daily Deal Product%%  is automatically added to the message.
At the time of send, the correct value will be added to the message, exactly where the personalization string is!
Click
The same steps were taken to add the price of the product to the message as well.
Also, you can see that we added a link to the product, so the contact can easily access the site to purchase the daily deal.
Notice that the preview is not showing a preview of the message.
that’s because mobilcconnect cannot generate a preview of a message when the message has personalization strings or ampscript
if you want to preview the message before you send it, use the test message field to send an example o fyour message to a test contact.
Click and drag
Because this is an outbound message, we need to identifiy a list or lists of contacts to send to
any available list will be listed here in the lists workspace
simply drag any lists you want to receive the message to the target lists box
and if you want to exclude a list from the send, be sure to drag it to the exclusion lists box
we’ll drag the Daily Deals Mobile Message to the target lists box and then next to continue
Click the Activate button
Here is the summary that we’ve seen while building other campaigns
to activate the send, we’ll click activate
Click the Confirm button
and then confirm
Click the cell
and finally, we can see that this message is now live and ready to go!
The daily deals outbound message campaign is set up and running!
And that’s how you create a outbound message campaign in mobileconnect

2.11 Congratulations
Welcome to the Mobile Connect 101 Outbound Message lesson.
Here is what you will learn in this lesson: the definition of outbound messages, typical use cases for outbound messages and how to create them.
Let's get started.
What is an outbound message?
The outbound message template allows you to send an SMS message from Mobile Connect to mobile phone users that opt in to receive SMS messages from you.
Outbound messages can be used to alert, inform and engage mobile users.
This is a great example of a way to use the outbound message template.
A new contact has opted in to receive SMS messages from NTO.
They receive a message that states, "Welcome to Northern Trailer Outfitters alerts.
Stay tuned to hear for special SMS only discounts and rewards.
Reply help for help.
Reply stop to cancel."
This is just a welcome message because they will still continue to receive outbound messages, but it's not a bad idea to include information like message frequency, types of messages, et cetera in that initial outbound message.
Or what about this use case, a social promotion via outbound.
The message NTO sends to opted-in contacts reads “NTO is running a Facebook contest starting this month, discover how you can win at www.Facebook.com/NTO.”
So, when the recipient clicks on the link they're going to be taken to the NTO Facebook page where they can sign up for the sweepstakes.
Who knows, they might even decide to add themselves to email lists that are listed on the form.
Now, NTO has really gone cross channel, mobile outbound message to a social Facebook page, and even an email opt-in value box on the sign up form.
You have a lot of flexibility when using outbound messages.
Here is how the outbound message works.
The Mobile Connect user has CTAs online and offline requesting their customers opt-in to receive outbound messages.
In this case, Daily Deals.
The mobile device user texts in the appropriate keyword to opt-in to receive the daily outbound SMS message.
A message is created in Mobile Connect and is scheduled to be sent each day to those who have opted in.
Data is updated each day so that the message goes to the most up-to-date list of opted-in contacts.
There are six steps necessary to creating an outbound message.
Step one, create an attribute.
You learned how to create an attribute in the data lesson in this course.
If you want to personalize messages you're going to be sending to contacts, you need to first create an attribute.
Next, create a keyword.
Administrators can create keywords for you.
This is covered in the administration lesson, or you can create a keyword during the outbound message creation process.
Steps three and four, create a list and import to a list.
You learned how to do this during the data lesson.
It makes sense that you would need a list to send an outbound message to, right?
Once those four steps are complete, it's time to move on to step five, which is when you will create the outbound message.
Finally, in step six, you send the message.
We'll complete steps five and six in this lesson.
Here is the Northern Trail Outfitters' outbound message scenario.
Northern Trail Outfitters wants to send a daily deal text message to customers who have opted in to receive the messages.
They will use an outbound message campaign to send messages each day.
A text message with the product information, price and link to the daily deal on their website will be sent each morning at 9 AM.
The following video will walk you through the process of creating an outbound message using Mobile Connect.
Congratulations.
You have completed the Mobile Connect 101 outbound message lesson.
Go ahead and close this lesson, and choose the next one you'd like to take.
We'll simply click Create Message in the upper right corner to create the outbound message.
Here is step one.
We need to select the outbound template.
Now we've moved on to step two of the process and you can see the message is named Daily Deal Message.
Next, we need to select the appropriate short or long code.
We'll choose short code 59545 and we'll skip the Next keyword.
Under the messages heading, we need to identify the send method.
Will it be scheduled, meaning the message will be sent immediately or at the date and time we determined in the last step of the message creation process,
API triggered, the message will be sent via an API call, automation, the message will be created in such a way that it can be automated using Automation Studio and that's our use case today.
This is the perfect example of an outbound message that we would want to automate.
It goes out everyday at the same time, why not place it in an automation?
Or, it can be sent as an interaction for use with Journey Builder.
We'll choose the automation send method.
You can see that our message starts with “today's daily deals.”
Now we want to add a dynamic element to our message.
The deals change daily.
Each day, we do an import of new opt-in contacts and a new daily deal product and price data as well.
The data is stored as attributes in Contact Builder.
We only want to create this message once, so we can add personalization strings to the message so that at the time of send,
the appropriate and most up-to-date product and price information is added to the message.
In other words, each day the daily deal changes and we have to import the data before the message is sent.
This way, the correct message is sent.
To add the attribute values, we will click on Insert Content.
First, we want to add the personalization string for the daily deal product.
We'll choose that attribute and we can see that the personalization string %%dailydealproduct%% is automatically added to the message.
At the time of send, the correct value will be added to the message, exactly where the personalization string is.
The same steps were taken to add the price of the product to the message as well.
Notice that the preview is not showing a preview of the message.
That's because Mobile Connect cannot generate a preview of a message, when the message has personalization strings or AMPscript.
If you want to preview the message before you send it, use the Test Message field to send an example of your message to a test contact.
Because this is an outbound message, we need to identify a list or lists of contacts to send to.
Any available list will be seen here in the Workspace.
Simply drag any of the lists that you'd like to receive a message to the Target List box, and if you want to exclude a list from this end, be sure to drag it to the Exclusion List box.
We'll drag the Daily Deals Mobile Message to the Target List box and then click Next to continue.
Here is the summary that we've seen while building other campaigns.
To activate this end we'll simply click Activate.
Finally, we'll click Confirm to complete the process.
Now we can see that this message is live and ready to go.
The Daily Deals outbound message campaign is set up and running.
That's how you create an outbound message campaign in Mobile Connect.

{}Create Stored Content{}
Untitled Slide
There are many tasks that administrators of a mobile connect account do.
One of these tasks is to create stored content that can be used by users of the account to populate messages.
Let’s take a closer look
{}Stored Content{}
{}What is Stored Content?{}
Content that is created by an Administrator that allows users to re-use content over and over in messages sent via MobileConnect.
{}How is it used?{}
Stored Content can be Header or Footer information.
Not only do they begin and end the message, they ensure consistency.
Header examples are, Welcome to NTO Alerts! and Thanks for subscribing.
Footer examples are, Reply STOP to cancel, or Msg & Data rates may apply.

Not only do they begin and end the message, they also ensure consistency.
Header examples are:  welcome to NTO Alerts! and thanks for subscribing
footer examples might be reply stop to cancel or msg & data rates may apply
When creating a new message, you can choose which header and footer (s) to include.
Note on stored content:
A maximum of three headers and footers can be created.
Characters are included in total message character count.

{}Set a Blackout Time{}
Untitled Slide
Administrators are also responsible for identifying potential blackout times and making sure that the account has the appropriate time set.
Here is more information about blackout times
{}Blackout Time{}
{}What is a Blackout Time?{}
It is a period of time during which no messages will be sent.
{}How is it used?{}
A Blackout Time is used to prevent contacts from receiving messages at inopportune times.
By setting a Blackout Time, an Administrator is ensuring that messages will not be scheduled and sent during the identified time.

{}Create Keyword{}
Untitled Slide
Keywords are the action words in a mobile campaign.
The administrator can create keywords for users, or the users can create their own.
if an administrator creates a keyword for users, they will do it in a different part of the application than a user would.
Let’s learn more about where and how adminstrators can create keywords.
{}Keyword{}
{}What is a Keyword?{}
A keyword is a unique, identifying word that enables you to interact with your customers via SMS or MMS.
A keyword is used as the action word that kicks off a specific campaign within MobileConnect.
{}How is it used?{}
A consumer might text COUPON to a short code to receive a 20% off coupon, or SIGNMEUP to join an email list.

a typical way that a keyword mioght be used is as a call to action to encourage a  mobile device user text the keyword coupon to a short code to receive a 20% off couon, or the mobile device user might text signmep to join an email list.
some important things to note:
a keyword can be 2 - 25 characters in length
Can contain numbers and special characters
Can be set up by the Administrator or by the user while creating a campaign

Click the text box
Click Administration to get to the administration workspace
Click the Add link
The stored content is found in the upper center of the page.
As an administrator, you can create stored headers, or stored footers
the creation process is the same, so we’ll create a stored header to be used with NTO Alerts in the future
Notice that you can only create 3 headers and 3 footers
Once a header or footer is created, it will be listed here and the counter will keep track of the amount of stored content you have available.
to begin the process, we are going to click add next to headers
Click
In the Headers dialog box, we’ll click Add New
Type Welcome To NTO Alerts!
We could insert content if we wanted, shorten a url, or abbreviate words, just like when we create a message.
THat’s not our use case, so we’re going to add welcome to NTO Alerts to the value box.
Click the Save button
and then Save
Click
And our stored header content is now listed here.
So, any user of the mobileconnect account can add this header to messages that they create.
THey simply would click o nthe insert content drop down to add it to a message.
You’ll see the number has now changed to 2 availble headers to create.  if we want to edit the or delete the created header, we would click the edit link.
the same steps would be taken in order to create footer content as well.

Click the text box
to create a blackout time, Click Administration to get to the administration workspace
Click the Set Blackout Window link
THe administrator can create a blackout window time by locating the send blackout area in the upper right corner of the adminstration workspace
To begin the process, we will click the set blackout window link
Click
Once the blackout window is enabled, we need to identify the timeframe for the blackout.
The start time is found on the left side – our window is from 11:30 pm to 8:30 am
we’ll select 11:30 pm as the start time
Click the 8:30 AM list item
and 8:30 as the end time
Click the Save button
and to complete the task, we’ll click save
Click
now we can see that the send blackout time for this account is from 11:30 pm to 8:30 am.
If we need to change the time, we can click edit and update it to the appropriate send blackout period.
And that’s how an administrator can set the send blackout time in MobileConnect
View Scene
Click the text box
it’s very easy to create a keyword as an administrator.
To begin the process, simply click the administration link in the tool bar at the top
Click the text box
and once in the administration nworkspace, we need to select the short code for the keyword.
In this case, there is only one short code in this account, so we’ll click on the shortcode
Type NTO
To create a keyword, simply type in the name of the keyword in the Create Keyword value box.
We’ll add NTO to the box.
Because keywords need to be unique across a particular short code, we will be shown immediately if the keyword is available or not.
In this case, NTO is a keyword we can use.
The last step is to simply click create.
Click the cell
now we can see that the NTO keyword is available for campaigns.  and that is how an administrator will create a keyword in  the adminstration workspace.

To begin the process, we're going to click Add next to headers.
In the Headers dialog box, we'll click Add New.
We can insert content if we wanted, shorten a URL, or abbreviate words just like when we create a message, but for us today we're simply going to add, "Welcome to NTO alerts" to the value box.
To complete the process, we'll simply click Save.
Our stored header content is now listed here.
Any user of the Mobile Connect account can add this header to messages that they create.
They simply would click the Insert Content drop-down to add it to a message.

That's how an administrator can set the send blackout time in Mobile Connect.
It's very easy to create a keyword as an administrator.
To begin the process, simply click the Administration link in the toolbar at the top.
Once in the Administration workspace, we need to select the short code for the keyword.
In this case, there is only one short code in this account.
So we'll click on the short code.

We'll add “NTO” to the box.
Because keywords need to be unique across a particular short code, we will be shown immediately if the keyword is available or not.
In this case,
NTO is a keyword we can use.
The last step is to simply click Create.
Now we can see that the NTO keyword is available for mobile campaigns.
That's how an administrator will create a keyword in the Administration workspace.

Resources & Tools
{}Speaker1:{}
Let’s first begin with understanding the resources and tools to help you implement salesforce.
{}Bookmark this URL:{}
{}www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted{}
Getting Started Quickstart
{}Speaker1:{}
New customers tell us they need help understanding where to start.
We’ve listened and consolidated the most critical resources into one central hub, called our Getting Started Quickstart page.
Bookmark the following webpage: www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted.
All the resources we’ll be discussing are accessible through this webpage.
Now, let’s dive in to the detail.
Getting Started Series
Live Webinars
On Demand Videos
http://www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted
{}Speaker1:{}
Customers also asked for guidance around implementing salesforce, so we created the Getting Started Series.
This four part series provides prescriptive steps for getting up and running with salesforce, taking you from preparation to deployment.
The content is divided into 4 main parts, including:
Prepare for success, where you’ll learn how to prioritize your business objectives
Create the user experience, which will provide you best practices on setting up salesforce to align with your business
Enable the User Experience with Data, which will focus on tips on how to prepare, import, and manage your data
and Deploy and Empower your end users, which will provide guidance on training, support, and motivation techniques to drive adoption
This series will arm you with the information you need to deploy salesforce.
Access the Getting started quickstart for links to register for live webinars and view on demand videos.
Set-Up Salesforce Series
http://www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted
{}Speaker1:{}
As you make your way through the series, another resource we want to highlight as part of our Create the User Experience step is the Setup Salesforce Series.
We created demonstration videos where saleforce experts guide you through completing baseline customization tasks, such as setting up users or leads.
After watching the demonstration, you can then access a step by step walkthrough which takes you directly in to your instance of salesforce to perform the task.
Let’s talk through an example:
A common task customers need to complete is creating a custom field.
To learn how to perform this task, begin with watching the Setup leads video.
Then, when you’re ready to customize, select the ‘add lead custom field’ walkthrough.
Get step by step guidance within your instance of Salesforce.
Walkthroughs
http://www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted
{}Speaker1:{}
The walkthrough goes directly to the lead setup area within your instance of salesforce.
It will take you step by step through the process of creating a new field within your lead object.
You’re not only viewing the steps, your completing them as you work your way through each step of the walkthrough.
By the end of the Setup Series, you will have completed the baseline steps for customizing salesforce.

Think of the workbook as your checklist to deploy salesforce.
Use it to <size val="1100"><kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">document your decisions, define how to tailor salesforce to your business, and find links to relevant resources.</font></fill-sd></kern></size>
The workbook will be a valuable reference document and a helpful tool to access as your business needs evolve.
Be sure to download the Getting Started Workbook from the quickstart page.
This will help you begin to understand the steps you will work through in the upcoming weeks.
Success – Getting Started Community
http://www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted
Get answers.
Stay connected.
{}Speaker1:{}
Customers also requested a place to ask questions and learn from others, which is why we created the Success – Getting Started group within our Success Community.
This forum was built to provide new customers a place to engage with salesforce experts and other customers like you.
Let me share two examples we saw last week within the Getting Started community;
- A new customer who has never implemented salesforce, posted a note to the community asking for their top 2 lessons learned during the implementation process.
He quickly received 10 posts from other customers and partners sharing their experiences.
- Another example is more specific.
A new customer had created custom fields on leads and needed to understand how to carry over these new fields to a converted opportunity.
She posted her question, and within an hour, she had answers from both a salesforce expert and a customer giving her a solution.
As a success resource here at salesforce, my goal is to make sure there is no question left behind in our community.
Later in the webinar, we’ll show you exactly how to join and take advantage of this valuable resource.
Meet the new user experience in Salesforce
Lightning Experience is a new, modern user experience in Salesforce
Lightning Experience
Salesforce Classic
{}Speaker1:{}
First, I want to take a moment to introduce our re-vamped user interface, called Lightning Experience.
Lightning was recently released in October 2015 and is primarily focused on providing sales users a more productive interface.
It is designed to enhance ease of navigation, data entry, and usability.
We are aware that some of you watching may still be using the previous user interface, now referred to as Salesforce Classic.
Some features are not yet supported in the Lightning experience, but are still available in Salesforce Classic.
Now, you might be asking yourself, “am I on the new Lightning Experience or Salesforce Classic”?
The best way to determine what you are using today is to view your home screen.
Lightning Experience
{}Speaker1:{}
(1) When you first log in to salesforce, do you see a vertical navy bar displaying icons running down the left side of the screen?
If yes, you are on the Lightning experience.
Classic Experience
{}Speaker1:{}
(2) If you log on and instead see a horizontal row of tabs across the top of your screen, then you are on Salesforce Classic.
General navigation is different in Lightning versus Classic.
If you are currently using the new Lightning experience, keep watching.
Getting Started Series
On Demand Videos
<lnk-c val="&lt;a:hlinkClick r:id=&quot;rId3&quot;/&gt;">{}www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted</lnk-c>{}
{}Speaker1:{}
The demos we perform in this webinar will be shown on the UI selected by the audience majority from our next poll.
We’ll be covering tips and terminology that applies to everyone regardless of whether you are using Lightning or Classic.
All of our webinars are available as a recordings.
We’ll be sending you an email with direct links to our on demand videos, or you can find our video link within the Getting Started Quickstart page.
We’ve included video demonstrations in both the classic and lightning experience, so be sure to watch the one that’s most relevant to you.
Learn how to navigate Salesforce
{}Speaker1:{}
Now, let’s take the time to go through how to navigate Salesforce with the new Lightning Experience user interface.
We’ll share some Salesforce terms to help you become familiar with key areas of the application.
We will cover the home page, the navigation bar, and app launcher.
We’ll share the new layout for our most common objects including the Lead, Account, contact and Opportunity records.
Then, we’ll cover how to get to the setup for configuration and customization.
Let’s dive in!

Elements of the home page
An intelligent way to start your day fast
{}Speaker1:{}
WHEN YOU first login to salesforce, you will land on the home page.
Here are a few key areas I want to highlight:
On the left hand side is the collapsable Navigation Menu, which allows you to easily navigate through your business data and objects within your salesforce account.
In the top middle of the home page is a performance chart.
This area will help you monitor how close you are to reaching your sales performance goals.
Below the performance chart, you’ll find Account Insights, which provides updates and highlights about your most important accounts.
The far right hand side is labeled Assistant and helps sales reps identify exactly what they need to be doing today based on activity information .
At the very top you will see the Global Search Bar.
This is a powerful search engine that will guide you to records in Salesforce.
It is important to note you can use an “*” as a wild card in searches.
This new Lightning Experience home page is not yet customizable.
We know customers want the ability to modify what appears on this home page, and this flexibility will be added in a future release.
Also, not all of your objects will appear in the navigation menu.
To view more objects, let’s navigate directly to the App Launcher.
{}App Launcher{}
App Launcher
View all of your applications via the App Launcher
{}Speaker1:{}
Users can find applications by searching for the app name in the global search bar or by using the App Launcher.
(1) The App Launcher appears at the top right hand corner of every page.
(2) Click on the icon containing several small tiles, and this will bring up the App Launcher.
Apps display as large tiles and are labeled with (3) sales, marketing, and more.
Access to all custom objects, are located within the Other Items tile.

{}Speaker1:{}
There are several ways to find what you’re looking for fast.
When you click into the global search bar at the top of the page, you’ll see a drop down of your recently viewed items.
When you know what you’re looking for, you can begin typing and the search bar will try and match your search and display records that match your criteria.
The search function also displays your results placing your most frequently used objects at the top of the list.
List Views
See your data, your way, with easy filters and visualization tools
{}List View Charts{}
Visualize your lists on the fly with a bar or donut chart

{}Speaker1:{}
In Lightning Experience, when you access a specific object, you are taken directly to a list view.
You can manage your list views right from this page, use the Filter widget to add, set or remove filters and also get quick visualizations of your business data with Charts.
Using Setup
{}Speaker1:{}
To navigate to the setup menu, go to the upper right hand corner of every page and click on the Gear icon and select "Setup Home“ from the Quick Access Menu.
Our Setup page provides a streamlined interface for viewing and managing your administrative setup tasks.
The Quick Find (1) search lets you quickly navigate to any node using a keyword.
Quick Find is the best way to find what you're looking for if you know its name and it’s your power tool for getting where you need to go!

{}Opportunities{}
Any <fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;00A1E0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{}potential revenue-generating sales deal{} </fill-sd>or event you want to track.
{}Accounts{}
Organization with an <fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;00A1E0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{}established relationship</fill-sd>{} to your company.
{}Activities{}
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;00A1E0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{}A detailed interaction log</fill-sd>{} for a call, a follow-up task or a calendar event.
Our sales cloud standard objects in Salesforce includes Leads, accounts, contacts, opportunities and activities.
Let’s discuss each in more detail:
Leads are people who are interested in your products and services but have not yet purchased.
They are typically unqualified leads and generally come in from websites, events and purchased lists.
Often leads are the handoff mechanism between Marketing and Sales.
Accounts are companies that you have a relationship with, including:
Prospects, Customers, Partners and Competitors
Contacts are people associated with an Account that matter to your business.
Examples include:
Sponsor and Decision Makers, Influencers, Assistants and Partners.
Opportunities are potential revenue-generating sales deals that you wish to track through a sales process until the deal closes.
They are used to view pipeline and determine actions needed.
Activities are call logs, follow-up tasks, calendar events and emails associated with a managing your Leads, Contacts, Accounts and Opportunities.
The Fundamental Objects of a Sales Process

Now, we’ll take you through a demonstration of a typical sales journey.
We’ll show you:
1) how to create a lead and associate a task to the lead,
How to qualify and covert the lead into an account, contact, and opportunity.
How to Track your opportunity through your sales process
And how create new contacts and opportunities within an account

I take the information down in our lead tab and create a follow-up task for a meeting scheduled tomorrow.
Create lead and create a new follow up Task.
{}Fast forward to tomorrow, I find out this is a great prospect, they have budget, our products are the right match so this is a qualified lead.{}

Administrators:
Set-Up Users
One of the first steps for Administrators is to set-up your users.
The reason we suggest setting up users at the beginning, is to help you assign your data appropriately as you are entering it into Salesforce.
Security basics for user setup
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;accent1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{}Role Hierarchy{} </fill-sd><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;3B3B3B&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">determines the level of visibility users have to records such as opportunities they don’t own</fill-sd>
Ensures that managers always have access to the same data as their employees
Usually mirrors your organization's structure
{}Sales Rep{}
{}Sales Manager{}
{}CEO{}
{}Sales Rep{}
{}Sales Rep{}
{}Sales Manager{}
{}Sales Manager{}
{}Central{}
{}West{}
{}East{}
You will see your own records and the records of your employees

When setting up users, you will need to create a role hierarchy and assign users to the roles.
Similar to an organization chart, a role hierarchy represents a level of data access that a user or group of users needs.
The role hierarchy ensures that users higher in the structure always have access to the same data as people lower in their structure.
Role hierarchies don’t have to match your organization chart exactly, but usually mirrors the general structure.
This is an item you should setup immediately.
There is more you can do with security however, this one step is our recommended task, set up your roles and then assign them to users when you create your users.
Steps to set-up users
Create role hierarchy
Enter users
Select appropriate profile and role

Make sure you fill out the user fields like title, company, phone numbers and address so any email templates you create later show their complete company information.
Follow these steps to set-up your users so they have access to Salesforce and so that they can be assigned to data as you enter it into Salesforce.
These steps are also included in the Getting Started Workbook, which may be downloaded with the link provided here.
</font>Here is a quick best practice, you can set up users with the “Read Only” profile which allows you to make them record owners but at the same time, they can login and start becoming familiar with Salesforce.

Key players are most directly involved in the details and are typically in charge of driving business process alignment efforts and overall implementation strategy and activities.

They will work closely with the system administrator, and help validate that salesforce is set up correctly to support their business objectives. </font></fill-sd></kern>
Supporting players are critical to the success of the implementation as well but play a more indirect role.
<font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}<animation4></font><kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}The Data Analyst is responsible for determining which data should be imported into salesforce.

Some of the best champions are sales reps who can help represent the needs of the people who will be using salesforce everyday. </font></fill-sd></kern>
<font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}<animation6></font><kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}Lastly, the Executive Sponsor drives the salesforce vision and communicates the strategy for what you want to accomplish.
Often they hold a senior leadership positions and encourage managers and end users to adopt Salesforce.
This role is critical.
Research indicates that having strong executive sponsorship is one of the top contributing factors to a successful implementation. </font></fill-sd></kern>
For mid to large-size companies, there are likely additional roles involved, such as integration leads, developers, and dedicated trainers.
And for smaller organizations, employees usually wear multiple hats.
For example, the role of executive sponsor and business process
owner could be the same person whose role is to own the strategy and make decisions on the business process.
{}Executive Sponsor{}
{}Business Process Owner{}
{}Champion(s){}

How should they participate?

Our getting started series was built to help new customers deploy salesforce and we’re often asked who should get involved in each area of the series.
Here are recommendations on which sessions are most applicable broken down by role.

Time to Value
Track Record of Success
Local Presence
Resources available to help to engage with a partner:
{}Speaker2:{}
Our recommendation is to engage with a certified implementation partner.
This has historically been the fastest path to success because partners have the skills and resources to get you up and running quickly.
Partners also have industry and product expertise, as well as connections to local resources who can assist you in person.
Engaging with a partner will increase your time to value.
Partners are flexible and can tailor an engagement to fit your requirements.
Some customers engage with partners for the entire implementation, from design to deployment.
Whereas others choose to leverage partners for a specific project or task.
For more information on where to find partners, visit our AppExchange and engage with your Account Executive.
We create a resource called Successfully Implement with Salesforce Partners.
This guide will help you understand the process of working with a partner and how to prepare.
Partners also typically help with launch strategy and planning - Communication, train the trainer, documentation etc. these are all things they can help you with but remember that you need to drive what you want from them.
Remember that some Partners simply come in and do the analysis and design while you execute if you have internal expertise.
There are many combinations of collaboration with partners.
We have a great resource for you to use that includes valuable advice when working with partners.
We recommend you view the materials from this training link on this slide!
You’ll find the link in the resource section of this deck.
Here is a quick story I want to share:
I worked with one customer that chose to self implement but hired a certified consultant for a fixed 20 hours.
The customer used that time to have the consultant validate processes, designs and train the sys administrator on how to implement and configure some of the more difficult tasks.
Gather Feedback
{}Speaker2:{}
Business users are stakeholders who should be involved from the planning phase through to deployment.
Let’s discuss how to gather feedback to drive a successful implementation.
{}Resistors have important information, don’t avoid them{}
Consider how people handle change
{}Neutrals{}
{}Resistors{}
What most people resist is being controlled – not change itself
Know your personalities
{}Champions{}
{}Early adopters{}
{}Speaker2:{}
Not everyone adapts to change easily, so understanding your users and how they will react is important.
Here are some examples of the types of learners you’ll likely confront and how they can help with the implementation:
1)  Early Adopters are great testers for your system.
They are comfortable with change and new technology, so make sure you utilize them for your testing process.
Champions are great trainers and advocates.
Often times they have been exposed to Salesforce and are very excited so utilize it again.
3)  The majority of your users will fall in the neutral bucket.
Make sure you work to have them provide feedback.
4)  And finally, resistors don’t like change.
However, they can help validate good design and drive success so listen to them and seek out their feedback.
{}Are you meeting your objectives?{}
{}Is your solution easy to use?{}
Form a change leadership team
Why
Help people fell consulted, not controlled
Evaluate and prioritize user requests
Form a team to provide ongoing feedback
Who
Invite early adopters and resistors to have a voice
Focus on individuals who are trusted <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;002044&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans Light&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans Light&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />by their peers
Ensure execs are included and informed
{}Speaker2:{}
We recommend forming a change leadership team to help drive a successful implementation.
This team will be responsible for analyzing and prioritizing feedback.
As we discussed earlier, you will confront users who will be resistant to change, so being proactive in listening and actioning feedback provides several benefits:
If users feel they have been consulted from the beginning, versus mandated to adopt, it will drive more commitment to the project.
Your change management team can evaluate and prioritize these requests to make sure feedback is being heard
and make sure this is an ongoing part of the process.
This group of individuals will be your standing team of consultants to help you evaluate and plan as you evolve Salesforce.
When you think about who should participate, you want to invite your early adopters and resistors to make sure everyone has a voice.
Make sure the people selected are respected and trusted by their peers
And be sure your executive team is included and informed on progress.
For smaller organizations, your team might be comprised of your system administrator, your executive sponsor or business owner and some key users.
For a larger organization, you’ll want to ensure all parties are represented but that your team doesn’t become so large that you can’t make decisions easily.
{}Have users validated their business processes within Salesforce?{}
Develop your validation process

Enlist your early adopters and resistors!) </font>
Document the validation approach.
Provide a test environment.
{}Speaker2:{}
Make sure you include user acceptance testing as part of your plan.
In addition to technical testing, test the entire business process.
We refer to this as end to end testing.
Write up a couple real-life business scenarios your users will confront once they're live on salesforce, and use those as test scripts.
For example, you’ll test your sales process using opportunities.
Start by creating an opportunity.
Are the sale stages correct?
Are the fields easy to navigate?
Is there a field where adding help text would make it more clear on what data is needed?
Here are some example questions to ask your testing team:
Was there any point where you were unsure of what to do next?
Was there any point where you completed a step and something unexpected happened?
Customers on Enterprise edition or above you have access to a sandbox environment for testing.
If you are on Professional edition or below, consider creating a test user for this validation process which you can later deactivate.

Be sure to download the Getting Started workbook from the resource link available below this video.
I includes a section that helps you outline your validation plan.
The workbook will help you define quickly the key considerations when you build out this plan.
Now {}<Speaker1>{} is going to discuss the importance of communication and getting the word out to your team.
Get the word out
{}Speaker1:{}
Project communication is one of the most important aspects of a successful CRM implementation.
Communication helps drive adoption by providing an understanding of:
What challenges Salesforce is solving
What benefits will be gained
What is needed from end users
And what end users need to know
{}Sponsor Engagement{}
{}Teaser Emaii{}
Building Phase
(Pre-Launch)
{}Launch Announcement{}
{}Sponsor and Champion Participation{}
Awareness Phase
(Week of Launch)
{}Teaser Email{}
{}Launch Recap{}
{}Sponsor Status Meeting{}
{}User Contest{}
Reinforcement Phase
(Post Launch)
Communicate with your users
Builds enthusiasm
Keeps your users updated
For High Impact:
Executive Sponsor Communicates
{}Speaker1:{}
We recommend developing a communication plan to build enthusiasm for the project.
Here are some examples broken down in phases.
For the build phase, engage your sponsors and champions to start promoting the project and upcoming launch.
Send out teaser emails stating some benefits end users will achieve with salesforce.
These communications are about creating buzz and excitement for what’s to come.
{}<animation 1>{}
The awareness phase is to announce the upcoming launch of salesforce to your end users.
Keep them informed by communicating the plan and timeline through kick off meetings and hosted office hours.
Invite your sponsors and champions to participate in these sessions to show their support publicly.
Ask the key users from your change leadership team to help communicate updates to their parts of the business.
This ensures you get wider buy-in and awareness.
Let your sponsors and champions help build engagement and energy!
And don’t forget to engage your executive sponsor to make an announcement and show their support of the project.
This will be a high impact message to the team.
{}<animation 2>{}
Finally, build a plan for post launch to keep the communication going.
Provide updates on end user adoption.
Continue to have your executive sponsors explain the value they are achieving.
Schedule status meetings with sponsors and key stakeholders to report progress and maintain their engagement.
You can even design user contests to generate excitement, adoption, and commitment to the project.

We provided a sample communication plan within the Getting Started Workbook to help you get a jump start on building out your own plan.
Documenting when and how you will communicate will help align the team on the overall communication strategy.
{}Collaboration in Action{}
{}Key Files to Share{}
{}Additional Files Shared{}
Best Practice:
Collaborate right from the start
Chatter Quickstart
{}Speaker1:{}
We also recommend creating a chatter group dedicated to your salesforce project.
Chatter is a natural fit to help with the rollout by providing  one central location to consolidate all collateral and conversation around the project.
Use this group to share important milestones and timelines.
Upload all training documents and collateral used to support the launch.
As an Administrator, you can upload resources and communicate your training plan through chatter.
Encourage users to share feedback and ask questions within the group in order to capture all conversation in this central location.
This also makes it clear to users where they need to go to find resources, get information, and ask questions related to the project.
By introducing users to Chatter early on, they’ll immediately understand the benefits of collaboration in Salesforce.
Creating a Chatter group is easy.
We’ll share how to create a chatter group in the demonstration chapter of this Prepare video series.
And to learn more about Chatter, review the Chatter quickstart page which is included in the resource deck directly below this video.
Meet the new user experience in Salesforce
{}Speaker1:{}
We are now going to hop into a demo but First, I want to take a moment to introduce our re-vamped user interface, called Lightning Experience.
Lightning was recently released in October 2015 and is primarily focused on providing sales users a more productive interface.
{}Speaker1:{}
When you first log in to salesforce, do you see a vertical navy bar displaying icons running down the left side of the screen?
If yes, you are on the Lightning experience.
{}Speaker1:{}
If you log on and instead see a horizontal row of tabs across the top of your screen, then you are on Salesforce Classic.
General navigation is different in Lightning versus Classic.
We’ve included video demonstrations in both the classic and lightning experience, so be sure to watch the one that’s most relevant to you.

Identify and prioritize goals
{}Speaker1:{}
Once you’ve opened the lines of communication in your organization you’ll be able to clearly identify and prioritize your goals.
{}<animation1>{}The first thing you want to address are your pain points and challenges at your company.
{}<animation2>{}Answer questions to uncover these challenges, like what obstacles are impacting revenue generation, or how can we improve our sales processes?
{}<animation3>{}Next,  identify and prioritize your goals to begin building your roadmap.
This prioritization step is often missed, but very important.
Each goal your team creates should be ranked in terms of importance and impact to the business.
Then, priority is agreed upon across the key stakeholders.
{}<animation4>{}From your goals you will have business priorities, such as winning more deals or increasing sales rep efficiency.
And finally define how and what you will measure in salesforce to understand if you are achieving your goals.
Identify and prioritizing goals and how you will measure progress is a collaborative effort across the entire team.

Let’s walk through an example.
{}<animation1>{}We start by articulating our pain point and challenge.
We know we’re losing deals to competitors, but we don’t know who or why.
We want the ability to track competitors in our sales process and build a strategy on how to better position our products and services against these competitors.
{}<animation2>{}Our goal is to enable our reps to capture who they are competing against, and why we lose the deal.
{}<animation3>{}This is a top priority across our organization as we strive to win more deals and increase are revenue.

Measure your success
{}Speaker1:{}
Once your goals and priorities are defined, it is important to create a plan on how you will measure implementation success.
Metrics can be tracked from the beginning and provide guidance around what’s working well and identify areas for improvement.
Why measure success?
{}Measurement is crucial for your{} {}implementation success!{}
Know what’s working and what’s not
Justify your investment
Reward desired behavior
Ensure the expected value
{}Speaker1:{}
Measurement is crucial for the adoption of business systems like Salesforce.
You need quantifiable results so that you have something tangible to report back to the business showing the value obtained from Salesforce.
Create metrics that track end user adoption and measure against your goals to gain insight on progress.
Keep this data within the context of the use cases you identified at the beginning of the process.
Measurement helps you know what’s working and what’s not.
Adoption and success will evolve.
Data analysis can help you identify areas that need adjustment and the team can prioritize based on importance.
For example, if you’re using salesforce to drive pipeline, you can measure the volume of new opportunities being created.
If it seems low, the team can proactively reach out to sales, uncover blockers, then drive improvements.
This information is essential in helping your stakeholders justify their investment.
They want to be assured that the expected business value is achieved.
For example, are you closing deals faster, finding competitor information quickly?
It also provides an opportunity to reward desired behaviors.
You can reward your power users to encourage adoption.
You have invested in Salesforce as a business tool, are you realizing your goals?
Are you receiving the value you expect from the system?

{}Measure Business Performance{}
Engagement
Productivity
Effectiveness
{}Speaker1:{}
Next, let’s walk through some examples of what to measure.
We’ve broken this into 3 categories: engagement, productivity, and effectiveness.
Success metrics will evolve over time, but at the start of your deployment, you will want to understand how users are adopting the system and track the quality of data being entered.
We have Adoption and Data Quality Dashboards available for download on the AppExchange.
These prebuilt dashboards include reports and dashboard components that allows you track metrics like:
who’s logging in? how many opportunities or activities records are being created? is there data missing with opportunities?
This insight allows your Salesforce team to track progress and measure adoption.
We’ll cover how to download dashboards from the appexchange in the demonstration video in the next chapter.
{}<animation 1> {}It’s important to gather feedback.
We shared in chapter 2 how you can track feedback through using a chatter group.
You can also explore using a formal survey with your users to get feedback and measure overall sentiment.
Are users satisfied with salesforce?
Can they collaborate easily?
Can they find content?
Are they closing deals faster?
Capturing this type of insight is best suited for a survey.
There are a number of survey tools available on the appexchange.
{}<animation 2> {}Effectiveness relates to company specific key performance indicators.
These are concrete business metrics that will resonate with a CEO, CFO, or a business manager and they are unique to every company.
For example, a sales-driven company may tie success to decreasing the length of the sales cycle or increasing win rates against competitors.
Your company will decide which metrics you want to measure to understand how salesforce is impacting the business.
We cover examples in the Enable your user experience with data session, where we talk through prebuilt reports and dashboards that can give you a jump start on analytics.

{}Update workbook with priority categories, etc.{}
Earlier, we used the Getting Started Workbook to outline our business goals and how we would measure success.
Now, use the workbook to document how you’ll measure progress by identifying what adoption means to your organization and how you will measure it.
Typically, customers take a phased approach to analyzing adoption.
It’s important to have quick wins that provide encouragement to users, so make your goals realistic and attainable so you can celebrate achievements and milestones.

Define your sales process
{}Speaker1:{}
Outlining your basic sales process is one of your first steps as you implement Salesforce.
This will help you define much of what you will configure in salesforce, from custom fields and sales stages to page layouts and reporting needed.
The Fundamental Objects of a Sales Process
Leads
Accounts
Contacts
Opportunities
Activities
{}Speaker1:{}
Before we start, let’s talk about the sales cloud standard objects in Salesforce.
Leads, accounts, contacts, opportunities, let’s go into more detail
What is a Lead?
{}Leads{}
The people interested in your products or services
{}Sources{}
Where you get your leads
{}Activities{}
Actions like tasks, calls, and events
{}Speaker1:{}
Leads are people who are interested in your products and services but have not purchased before or it they may indicate an opportunity to sell to an existing customer.
Generally, these come in from websites, events and purchased lists, often these are the handoff mechanism between Marketing and Sales.
They are often used by Inside Sales to facilitate qualification of potential deals
They’re fundamental to performing any kind of marketing ROI analysis
They’re separate from your company's Accounts, Contacts, and Opportunities
They’re necessary to take advantage of the Salesforce anti-duplication utility
You will want to track lead sources to understand the best source for your leads, ROI, etc.
You will also want to track the activities associated with the lead to understand where a lead is cold, what actions are driving conversions, etc.
Define your Lead Process
Map Your Process to Salesforce CRM Functionality
Map your ideal process to Salesforce CRM and establish the names you give to your data elements and the fields in Salesforce CRM.
Determine how you will measure and track
How you will measure conversion and top performers?
Determine how Leads will be assigned and qualified
How do you manage unassigned leads?
Identify Lead sources
Where do leads come from?
So here are the steps you should follow to build your processes around leads
Where do your leads come from?
• You probably will acquire leads by importing, creating manually, or automatically capturing them from your website.
<Animation 1> Next, How will you assign and qualify your leads?
You’ll need to determine the process where leads are assigned and qualified so think about that.
<Animation 2> You’ll want to determine how you will measure and track your leads
For example, how will you measure conversion and top performers
<kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;-112&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;MS PGothic&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;-128&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;ＭＳ Ｐゴシック&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;-112&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;-128&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;"><Animation 3> And then finally, you will map this lead process to salesforce functionality.</font></fill-sd></kern>
Use the Getting Started workbook to help with this mapping.

{}(Deal Information){}
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;074051&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Company </fill-sd><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;002044&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Information</fill-sd>
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;002044&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Contact </fill-sd><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;074051&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Information</fill-sd>
Deal Information
Lead Conversion
<size val="1100">{}Speaker1</size>:{}
<animation 1> Once the lead is a qualified opportunity, it is converted.
<animation 2>
<animation 3> The company information such as brand name and location are captured on the account.
<animation 4> The contact information such as individual name and email are captured on the contact.
<animation 5> And the deal information such as potential revenue, anticipated close date are captured on the opportunity.
Let’s dig into each of those standard objects.
What is an Account?
{}Accounts{}
Companies that you have a relationship with
{}Partners{}
Customers
Competitors
{}Prospects{}
<size val="1100">{}Speaker1</size>:{}
Accounts are companies that you have a relationship with, including:
Prospects – these are organizations that are not yet customer but you’re working a deal
Customers – these are organizations that have purchased goods and/or services from you
Partners – these are organizations that work with you to sell goods and/or services
And Competitors – these are organizations where you want to track who you compete against for business
What is a Contact?
{}Contacts{}
People in an account who matter to your business
{}Decision makers{}
Partners
Influencers
{}Assistants{}
<size val="1100">{}Speaker1</size><km val="0"><strike val="noStrike"><kern val="0"><cap val="none"><spc val="0"><normh val="0"><ln val="&lt;a:ln&gt;&lt;a:noFill/&gt;&lt;/a:ln&gt;"><eff-l val="&lt;a:effectLst/&gt;"><ul-f val="&lt;a:uLnTx/&gt;"><fill-uf val="&lt;a:uFillTx/&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;-112&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;MS PGothic&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;-128&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;ＭＳ Ｐゴシック&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;-112&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;-128&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">:</font></fill-uf></ul-f></eff-l></ln></normh></spc></cap></kern></strike></km>{}
Contacts are people associated with an Account that matter to your business.
Examples include:
Sponsor/Decision Makers
Influencers
Assistants
Partner Liaisons
What is an Opportunity?
{}Opportunities{}
Potential revenue-generating deals
{}Forecast Revenue{}
Generate Pipeline
{}Track Deals{}
<size val="1100">{}Speaker1</size><kern val="0">:</kern>{}
Opportunities are:
Potential revenue-generating sales deals that you wish to track through a sales process until the deal closes.
They are used to view pipeline and determine actions needed (for example more leads into the funnel; deals staying too long at a certain stage).
Opportunities are set up with consistent opportunity stages and probability to allow you to forecast sales by projected close dates.
Define your Sales Process
Map Your Process to Salesforce CRM Functionality
Map your ideal process to Salesforce CRM and establish the names you give <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1700&quot;&gt;&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;002044&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />to your data elements and the fields in Salesforce CRM.
Determine how you will measure and track
How you will measure win/loss ratios, won deals to quotas & top performers?
Determine your sales stages
What are the sequential steps your sales reps will go through as they manage their opportunities?
Define when an opportunity will be created
When a Lead is qualified, when does a sales rep create an opportunity?
Next is building your sales process.
We’ve given you some background.
You should have a common framework or a common language to manage the Sales Activities that drive sales performance.
You will want to identify the decision steps along the way that indicate when an opportunity should be created and then how to manage the sales process.
How you sell should determine how you configure salesforce.
At what point do you want your sales reps to create an opportunity?
That’s one of the first things that you should decide.
<Animation 1> Next, what are the sales stages you use, the defaults in salesforce can be changed to map to your process so what are the stages, that’s for you to decide and configure
<Animation 2> After your sales stages, make sure you identify how and what you will track for reporting and analysis.
<Animation 3> And then finally, you will map your sales process to salesforce functionality to complete your solution.
Use the Getting Started workbook to help with this mapping.
Qualification
Best Practice:
Define your sales process
Getting Started Workbook
Qualification
Discovery
Proposal
Negotiation
Won/Lost
{}My Sales Stage (SAMPLE){}
Stages
Enter this stage when:
Lead
Individual is not a current customer and interest is not confirmed
Qualification
Individual has been contacted and expressed interest
Discovery
Interactions to understand individual needs for a particular deal are in progress
Proposal
Proposal/quote is getting developed
Negotiation
Individual has proposal and has not made decision
Closed- Won/Lost
Individual accepts/rejects proposal
Here is a typical sales process from lead to closed won or lost.
<Animations >:
1) Your first contact with many customers will be as a lead.
Once qualified, they move to
2) Discovery, understanding timing, budget, who approves, products/services the customer is interested in, etc.
3) Next, you’ll probably prepare the initial quote or proposal
4) After that most deals will run through a negotiation process
5) Finally, you will mark the deal as closed won or lost
<Animation>You not only can adjust the stage names within Salesforce, you may also add or remove stages to align to your sales process.
Your opportunity stage values are one of the first things you should adjust in salesforce.
Your stages should reflect your sales process rather than the salesforce defaults.
We’ve provided recommended stages and definitions in the Getting Started workbook.
Take the time to agree on these stages within your organization, then adjust Salesforce to match your process.

{}Convert Lead{}
{}Speaker1:{}
Now that you know what the salesforce objects are that are involved in your sales processes, let’s talk about the end to end sales process.
<animation 1> Typically, an organization will bring interested prospects in by creating a lead
<animation 2> Next you’ll gather information about that lead
<animation 3> Eventually you may disqualify that lead, if it isn’t the right fit or does not have the potential for a sale
<animation 4> If you discover this is a qualified lead, one that you want to move into a formal sales process, you will convert that prospect to an account and contact with an opportunity.
You’ll have various activities along the way as you work with that customer
<animation 5> Ultimately, you’ll monitor and track the sales process along the way to either a won or lost opportunity
What you will want to discover are the decision points that occur during a sales cycle and map out these processes.
Create a seamless user experience
{}Speaker1 (if two speakers, Speaker2):{}
Simplifying the salesforce screens and layout makes the entire rollout of salesforce successful for your organization.
We are going to share some simple best practices that have a huge impact on adoption by your users.
What’s great about salesforce is how much you can easily configure.
Best Practice:
Modify Standard Fields
Define the adjustments to standard fields
Hide unnecessary fields <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;074051&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />and related lists
Set required fields
Update pick list values
Set default values
Utilize help text to <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;074051&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />guide users

Standard Fields in salesforce were designed to be flexible, and leave a lot of room for you to customize them and make them more useful to your instance.
Here’s a few things you can do to make standard fields work for you:
Use the Getting Started workbook to view the standard fields for the core sales objects.
We’ve provided a checklist for the recommended standard field changes within the workbook.
Let me walk through this checklist to give you some pointers.
Determine what adjustments you want to make to the fields to align to your business.
Fields that are not applicable to your business should be hidden to minimize data entry for your users and to avoid confusion.
Set required fields for fields that drive any reporting or processes.
Update pick list values so that the values shown in your dropdown are applicable.
This helps to minimize scrolling for your end users when entering data and helps to improve data quality.
Set default values where relevant.
It is common to set stages to default to the first stage.
And, finally, utilize help text for key fields where your users could benefit from additional guidance.
We recommend adding help text to your opportunity stage field to define each stage criteria.
This helps improve data quality and to minimize the questions you may receive from users when they start to use Salesforce.
Best Practice:
Add Custom Fields
Define custom fields needed
Add custom fields
Understand the value of formula fields
Leverage data types available
Adjust field location
Create validation rules (as appropriate)
Help & Training:
Creating Custom Fields
To tailor salesforce to fit your unique requirements, you can add custom fields for each of the tabs and objects that your organization uses.
There are several types of fields you can create, like a checkbox, a date field, and a text field.
Your Salesforce edition type will determine the amount of custom fields you can create.
After you have analyzed your needs, create the custom fields you will need to hold the data your team needs to enter
Utilize formula fields where possible, fields derived from other values.
An example would be bringing the account type down to the opportunity so you can see the account type on the opportunity but you don’t need to enter it.
Spend some time understanding the different data types available for custom fields, it is important you choose the right data type, text, currency, number, etc.
Another tip is to consider field location.
You want fields to be shown in the order the user will typically enter the data.
Group relevant fields together and keep your most important, required fields towards the top of the page.
Finally, as appropriate, you should consider creating validation rules.
These help to enforce data required based on other information entered.
For example, you would not want to allow a deal to move to closed-lost without capturing the loss reason.
We’ve provided some common custom fields for consideration in the Getting Started workbook.
Best Practice:
Organize your pages
Change field locations
Create new sections
Use meaningful section headers
Customize related lists
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;002060&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Help & Training:
</fill-sd><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;00A1E0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><lnk-c val="&lt;a:hlinkClick r:id=&quot;rId3&quot;/&gt;">Customizing Page Layouts with the Enhanced Page Layout Editor</lnk-c></fill-sd>
Let’s go over page layouts in detail.
A page layout allows you to arrange fields on the pages for each object in a particular order.
Page layouts control:
The layout and organization of Detail and Edit pages
Which fields, custom links, and related lists users see
Which standard and custom buttons display on detail pages and related lists.
And whether fields are visible, read only, or required.
Here are the steps we recommend:
Change field locations to have them make sense
Create new sections
Make sure you use meaningful section headers.
Customize related lists so you see the fields people want to see
One thing to note, for our Contact Manager, Group Edition, and Professional Edition customers, every user views the same layout.
Enterprise and above editions can create different page layouts for use by different profiles and record types, and set field-level security settings to further restrict users’ access to specific fields.
Best Practice:
Adapt Search Fields

This setup in salesforce is important for usability for your users and often overlooked!
Search layouts allow you to select the standard and custom fields that are displayed in salesforce’s search features.
This is a must-do to setup for each object in salesforce, don’t just use the defaults!
You are ensuring user adoption by testing their experience.
Validate your solution
Build a test scenario for your processes
Provide a test environment
Test your business processes

Demonstration presented on new Lightning Experience
We recently launched a new user interface called the Lightning experience.
This interface is primarily focused on making sales users more productive through enhanced ease of navigation, data entry, and usability.
When you log in to your salesforce instance, do you see a vertical navy bar displaying icons running down the left side of the screen?
If yes, you are on the new Lightning experience.
This video demonstration will be shown using the new lightning environment, but we also offer a video for customers still on our Classic user interface.
Classic Experience
If you log on to salesfore and instead see a horizontal row of tabs across the top of your screen, then you are on Salesforce Classic.
Classic Experience – Demo & Set-up Series

Deciding If Lightning Experience is Right For You
For our Salesforce Classic customers, <animation 1>we have the same demonstration in our “Classic” environment.
To access, navigate to the right side of this video screen to expose the additional chapters of the series.
Scroll down and look for the video chapter labeled as ‘Classic Demo’.
<animation 2> We also have our Set-up Salesforce series.
We created demonstration videos where saleforce experts guide you through completing baseline customization tasks, such as setting up users or leads.
After watching the demonstration, you can access a step by step walkthrough which takes you directly in to your instance of salesforce to perform the task.
These walkthroughs are not currently supported in our new lightning experience user interface, but accessible in Classic.
All customers can enable or disable the lightning experience for their salesforce instance.
For more information on the lightning and classic user interfaces, we encourage customers to take a look at our Trailhead resource entitled Deciding If Lightning Experience Is Right for You.

{}Introduction{}
Let’s demo some of the great features we just discussed.
I want to put them in context when we say design with the end in mind so let’s discuss a simple business scenario.
Our company wants to do a better job taking action early against competitors so that deals are not lost.
We’ve designed a business process where opportunities are marked with a competitor and sales representatives and sales management identify and take action earlier when competing for a deal.
{}Here are the competitor tracking requirements:{}
{}-{}Ability to capture the competitor while entering or editing the opportunity.
-Ability to access “At Risk” deals report to show deals at risk by competitor.

{}We’ve decided to add competitors as an Account and mark them with a value of “Competitor” in the type field as part of the design.{}
{}From our recommendations in part 2 we will show you how to:{}
-Create a new field on the opportunity page to add the Competitor
-Modify search changes for the Global Search results page so we can see that field called Type in our searches

Key considerations when importing and managing your data
{}Speaker2:{}
Let’s first begin with understanding the resources and tools to help you implement salesforce.
Importing your data:
Overview
Data Import Video Series
List your data sources and the names of the fields in which data is stored
{}Outlook{}
{}ACT{}
{}Legacy CRM{}
{}Gmail{}
{}Excel{}
{}Export File{}
Analyze and identify any potential problems <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;2000&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />with your data
Resolve issues and cleanse the data prior to import into salesforce
{}Speaker2:{}
To start, you need to identify what data you want to migrate, and understand where the data is coming from.
Common data repositories are legacy CRM systems, email, or excel spreadsheets.
<Animation 1> Data from these systems can be exported into a Comma-separated value format.
<Animation 2>
First, you need to identify the data you want migrate and understand the field names and properties of the data.
<Animation 3> Next, analyze the data and ask yourself and the team some key questions:
Do all records need to be migrated?
For example, do you plan to migrate old activities or archive them?
Does the data need to be cleaned or modified?
Have you removed duplicates?
<Animation 4>
Remember, dirty data in means dirty data out.
Be thoughtful and analyze the data you decide to import.
Take the time to resolve any issues with your import file to ensure you migrate a clean data set into Salesforce.
We highly encourage you to view the Data Import Series, which is located in the resources section of this video.
This 5 part video series covers in detail ways to clean your import file, prepare the file for upload, and prepare salesforce to receive the data.
Preparing your data for import

{}Speaker2:{}
Once you’re ready to begin importing data, realize that it isn’t necessary to import all of your data at the same time.
We recommend you start with the foundations that allow you to be up and running
<animation1> Accounts and contacts should be your first phase.
<animation2>In addition, any “open” records that may need action should be imported, like open opportunities or leads.
<animation3> You likely want to provide visibility of past actions associated with your account and contact records.
For these historical records, like closed opportunities or cases, import this data based on your reporting needs.
<animation4> You can archive any data that doesn’t need to live in salesforce and keep it for future reference if needed.
<animation 5> and finally, always run small test files for every import!
Load 5-10 records as a test run to ensure the import runs smoothly.
Be sure to view the cleaning and preparing Your Data Video within the Data Import Series, for more information
Examine your import
Examine your data prior to import and correct errors.
Data Import Video Series
{}Speaker2:{}
Duplicates are a major issue for many customers.
Not only does it mean work for the administrator to clean up, but it makes it difficult for your users to find the right information.
(1) Here is a common example.
We see Grand Hotels & Resorts listed as Limited and as LTD.
This would create two unique account records for what should be one account.
Bad data impacts user productivity and hurts the credibility of the system.
Gaining the trust of your user is critical for adoption, and providing good data is a big part of that trust.
Take the time to clean and remove duplicates prior to import.
(2) The Data Import series has a video dedicated to help guide you through cleaning up your import file.
Prepare for import and data import tools
{}Speaker2:{}
Now, let’s discuss how to prepare for the import and introduce the data import tools available.
Prepare your import file
Prepare your files to facilitate the import process.
‘Preparing Your Data for Import’ Article
{}Checklist{}
Use Salesforce field names
Include the record owner ID
Populate required fields
Use valid picklist values
Include an import batch field
Add Created By and Created Date fields
Include legacy system data ID
{}Speaker2:{}
Importing your data requires you to prepare your import files.
The file you plan to import into salesforce is called your source file.
Once you’ve removed duplicates, you’ll want to prepare your source file to help make the import process run smoothly.
Here’s a quick checklist:
Rename the columns in your file to match Salesforce field names.
Be sure to include a column for record owner ID, as records imported will need be assigned to a user in your system
Make sure to populate data for all of your required fields.
If you’re importing a picklist field , make sure all the picklist values match those available in Salesforce.
It can be very helpful to associate records to a specific source file, especially when you’re doing multiple imports.
Create a new field called ‘import batch’ and assign it a value tied to your source file.
This allows you to easily select imported records from a particular batch in case you need to delete, re-import, or simply identify where the data originally came from.
Add Created By and Created Date fields
You can also include the legacy ID for each record.
This is a useful way to tie your legacy data from another CRM system to salesforce.
For additional help, review the Preparing your Data for Import article within the help and training portal.
We'll include a direct link
within our resources link below this video.
Prepare Salesforce for the Import
Prepare Salesforce for the data import.
‘<lnk-c val="&lt;a:hlinkClick r:id=&quot;rId3&quot;/&gt;">Preparing Your Data for Import’ Article</lnk-c>
{}Checklist{}
Identify required fields
Create custom fields
Add valid picklist values
Add a field for legacy system data ID
Open Created By and Created Date fields<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />(open a case with Salesforce support for access)
Use formula fields when possible
{}Speaker2:{}
You’ll also want to make sure your Salesforce application is ready for the import.
Make sure all the fields you need to migrate from your source file are available in Salesforce.
Here’s a quick checklist:
Identify your required fields.
Create custom fields in salesforce as needed if none of the standard fields map to the data you’re importing.
Add or edit picklist values so they match the data in your source file.
If you’re migrating data from a legacy CRM system, make sure to create a custom field to store this legacy ID within Salesforce.
When you create new records, salesforce automatically sets the create date to the current date and the created by field is the user doing the import.
If you are importing from another CRM system, you’ll likely want to preserve the original record creator and creation date for this legacy data.
To do this, contact salesforce support and request to have the audit fields feature enabled.
This will allow you to override the default behavior and import records with their original Created By and Creation Dates.
This only works on record creation and not while  updating records.
Remember to use formula fields as well to avoid duplicate data entry
Data Import Wizard
Use the Data Import Wizard when:
You are loading fewer than <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />50,000 records
The object you need to import is supported by the Data Import Wizard
You want to prevent duplicates for Accounts, Contacts, Leads
Data Import Video Series
{}Speaker2:{}
We’ve shared how to prepare your source file and salesforce for the import.
Now, we’ll share two main tools salesforce offers for completing a one-time import of your data , The Data Import Wizard and the Data Loader.
The Data Import Wizard is run through the application and here are a few things to consider to decide which tool best fits your needs.
The import wizard is best used when working with smaller data loads, less than 50,000 records.
Make sure the objects you need to import  are supported by the data import wizard
We recommend using the Data Import Wizard to import Account and Contact data, as it is able to prevent duplicates from being created.
View the Data Import Series for additional guidance on Choosing the right tool.

Data Loader
‘Deciding on A Method for Importing Data’ Article
Data Import Video Series
Use Data Loader* when:
You need to import 50,000 to 5,000,000 records
You need to load into an object that <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />is not supported by the import wizards
You want to schedule regular <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />data loads
You want to export your data for backup purposes
{}Speaker2:{}
The second tool is called The Data Loader which is an API-based tool.
Here are some highlights of the tool:
The data loader is best used for importing large volumes of data (50,000 and more).
It’s commonly used to load data for objects not supported by the Data Import Wizards
The data loader also has the ability to schedule regular data loads
And the ability to export data for back up purposes.
The Data loader is available for Enterprise, Unlimited and Performance edition customers by default, and can be enabled for Professional edition customers when necessary for your implementation.
Contact support to have the data loader feature turned on.
Be sure to view the Data Import Series and our knowledge base article on Deciding on a method for importing data.

Import using Import My Accounts and Contacts
{}Speaker1:{}
{}Demo script – LEX UI:{}
{}These are the features I will be demonstrating:{}
A quick overview of a data import
Using Gmail as a source for an Accounts/Contact import file
I will discuss a few common issues that create duplicate Accounts during the data import process
Then I will demonstrate using the Data Import Wizard to import Accounts with Contacts and I will discuss a best practices around importing your Accounts and Contacts
{}Exporting data from data sources (Gmail contacts):{}
-Open browser to your Gmail’s Contacts section
-Show the Business Contacts folder that will have specific group of contacts to import into salesforce.
-Above the Contact list click More > Export > select “The Group ( Contact Folder  )” and specify folder
-Select Export format Outlook CSV as it is the easiest format to work with.
This will create a file that I will use for the import.
{}CSV File preparation best practices:{}
-Export the gmail contacts and open the .csv file
-Remove columns with no data or data your not going to import and just basically explain that any external system (eg. Gmail, linkedin, goldmine) can export data out to .csv format.
{}Open a sample .CSV file:{}
{}-{}Show/Explain Batch id field in column A, using the current date as a unique value.
“This is the field that I will use to relate an imported record to the import file this record originated from.
Here is the prepared file with the fields removed and the Batch ID column added.
-Explain each column and what type of field is being populated.
-Quick tip:
Mention Excel has a “Remove Duplicates” option and how it can be used
-Show Account duplicates “Grand Hotels & Resorts Ltd” & “Limited” and explain that two different records will not be created but 2 new contacts (John and Sam) will be created (Sample csv file: http://sforce.co/1Fq8D9l)
{}Ready for import of Accounts and Contacts using Data Import Wizard (DIW):{}
-Setup> Data Management > Data Import wizard (DIW)
-Data Import video series can be accessed right from the DIW page.  (review before starting)
-Click Launch Wizard and then select Accounts and Contacts > Add New records
Match Contacts by:
Email   ,   Match Account by:
Account Name & Account Site  (keep Trigger Workflows..
Unchecked)
Select CSV and Browse or Drag sample CSV to the wizard > Next
Map necessary fields including “Unique Batch” with “Account:
Import Batch” > Next
Click Start Import > OK
Explain the Bulk Load results page
Go to Accounts Tab and open “Today’s Accounts” List view and show all the new accounts/contact that were imported.
Explain why “sForce” and “Grand Hotels & Resorts Limited” was not imported as a dupes due to the match rule settings.
{}Mass Delete Accounts / Contacts:{}
In case your import had all errors you might want to back track and delete the records so you can use the Mass Delete tool.
Account Tab > Tools section > Mass Delete Accounts and show how to Mass Delete Today’s accounts based on the unique Import Batch field value as a criteria
Go through and Delete all the accounts (this will also delete the related Contact records)
{}Demo alternate Tool – Import Accounts/Contacts:{}
First explain the difference of when you’d use DIW vs. Import Accounts/Contacts vs. Data Loader.
(Send audience this link from Help & Training to show the limits of each import tool: https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=import_which_data_import_tool.htm&language=en_US)
{}Difference:{}

Good Data Management
‘<lnk-c val="&lt;a:hlinkClick r:id=&quot;rId3&quot;/&gt;">Validation Rule Article</lnk-c>
{}Speaker1:{}
During Chapter 1, we shared the importance of migrating clean data into salesforce.
(1) Once it's imported, you need a strong data management strategy to make sure the data stays clean and up to date.
The first step is to train your users to enter clean data with simple and easily repeatable steps.
Here are a few tips:
(2) Train your users to input quality data
(3 ) Standardize your data by using naming & address conventions
(4) And Prevent duplicates by making sure users search for records before creating new ones that may already exist in your database.
(5) Another aspect of good data management is enforcing the right behavior through configuration in salesforce.
There are a number of good customization options including:
(6)  The ability to create fields that are required on the page layout
(7) Using  picklist fields versus open text fields to give users a defined set of data points to choose from
(8) And using Validation rules to verify that the data a user enters in a record meets the standards you specify before that record can be saved.
A validation rule can be a formula or expression that checks the data and displays an error message to the user if the data entered doesn’t match what you want it to be.
(9) The help & traning portal has useful articles on validiation rules, including example rules and formulas you can utilize.
We included links to these assets within the resources document which you can download directly below this video.

You can adjust these reports and dashboards to monitor the data that’s important to your organization.
Best Practice:
Archive and Back up
{}Data Archive{}
Data you will not migrate
Storage plan for  import files
Data you will archive in Salesforce
{}Data Back up{}
Weekly Data Export Service
{}Included with Enterprise Edition and above{}
Export data using Salesforce Reports
Data back up options available on the  AppExchange
‘Exporting Backup Data’ Article
{}Speaker1:{}
There are 2 additional best practices we would like to share, Archiving data and Backing up your data.
<animation 1>
We recommend developing a plan around how and when you will archive data.
Before the initial import, decide what data will not be imported and archive that data in case you need to reference it in the future.
Next, have a plan for storing your import files.
And as you think about maintaining your data over time, decide if you will develop a plan to archive data that lives within salesforce.
Often customers remove leads after a certain period of time or activities older than X number of years.
<animation>
We also encourage you to develop a plan to back up your data to make sure you are protected from any internal mistakes that may occur.
We recommend performing a weekly export of your data.
Or, if you run a data project in the future, be sure to back up your data before you start.
Here are a few options to export your data:
The weekly export service is available for Enterprise edition customers and above.
This service allows organizations to export a complete set of their salesforce data including all attachments for archival purposes.
A system administrator can request a data export once every seven (7) days.
For our Professional edition customers, you can purchase this weekly export service for an additional fee.
Another option is to generate key data reports in salesforce and export to a CSV file.
This can be an effective backup for customers who do not have the weekly export service.
And Other options are available from third party partners on the Appexchange.
For more information, Review the help and training article around Exporting backup data.

Developing valuable reports & dashboards
{}Speaker1:{}
Now let’s discuss developing valuable reports and dashboards.
Better insight
Actionable data
Better decisions
Reporting as a monitoring and decision making tool
{}Speaker1:{}
Reporting is a great way to see how you or your company is performing.
However, we recommend you take this a step further and develop a strategic approach to generating actionable data, which can used to make decisions that specifically target performance improvements.
Here’s an example of actionable data:
If you’re company is losing business to competitors, it’s critical to know who, how often, and why.
Track these key data points in salesforce and require your reps to fill out the competitor name and reason lost whenever they lose to a competitor.
You then report on that data to give you the insights you need to adjust your competitive strategy.
If you find out that 70% of your competitive losses involve one specific company, or the primary reason for loss is that they got to the prospect first, you may want dedicate more budget and resources to uncover better leads and develop sales and marketing materials to help your sales representatives be more successful when up against that competitor.
STANDARD REPORTS
CUSTOM REPORTS
Out-of-the-box reports
Can be built from scratch
Stored in standard folders
Can be created from standard reports
Can be customized
Must be saved in a custom, personal, or unfiled folder
Cannot be deleted from the standard report folders
Can be overwritten or deleted
Use Prebuilt Reports
Reports are lists or summaries that allow you to aggregate and analyze your data in different ways.
Reports and Dashboards quickstart
{}Speaker1:{}
Now, let’s talk about some ways to get you up and running with reports and dashboards quickly.
Salesforce provides a rich collection of prebuilt, out of the box standard reports that you can tailor to fit your needs.
Standard reports are available for most objects, including opportunities, accounts, contacts, and administrative reports.
You can start with a standard report, then customize it to fit your requirements and save it as a new report.
These standard reports are always available as a starting point, and they can not be deleted from your standard report folders.
There are many standard reports available so you’ll rarely need to create a brand-new report, especially in the beginning stages of your implementation.
But as you get more comfortable with Salesforce and your reporting requirements evolve, explore some of the custom reporting options.
Benefits include the ability to create the report from scratch, you can start with a standard report and customize as needed, and you can save these reports in a custom, personal, or unfiled folder.
One note of caution.
Custom reports can be overwritten or deleted to those who have access, so make sure users are trained to ‘save as’ modifying a custom report.

Rule of thumb:
In general, if you can see the data, you can report on it.
{}Speaker1:{}
Use our prebuilt dashboards.
Again, we make it easy.
Dashboards are powerful analytic tools, giving you a combined graphical view of data from multiple reports.
To help get you started with them, we have a great dashboard pack available on the AppExchange that contains key dashboards for sales, marketing and support roles, and even for measuring login and adoption in your system.
This is a fast, easy way not only to measure success in your system, but to get dashboards that follow best practices.
Best Practices for Analytics Development
{}Make the data relevant to the audience - {}Think about the audience for the dashboard or report.
{}Group data logically – use space wisely:{}
A well-designed dashboard or report  will ensure that data is displayed in logical groups.
Present only the most important data.
{}Speaker1:{}
Here are some best practices to think of when designing your reports and dashboards:
Dashboards should be designed with the end user in mind.
Know the reason behind the dashboard and what needs are being met.
The physical layout of the dashboard makes a difference.
I tell people to tell a story with a dashboard.
Use the rows and columns logically and use titles and subtitles to help tell the story.
Remember, people read left to right, top to bottom.
The left hand top component occupies a key location on your dashboard, use that to your advantage.
Use footers to support the story, it is where you can put the question being answered by the component.

Demonstration (Optional)
Require a field on a page layout
Create a Validation Rule
Create a formula field
{}Speaker1:{}
{}Demo script – LEX UI:{}
Next I am going to show three simple features that we recommend to help your users input accurate data:
How to set a field as required when creating a salesforce record
How to require a field based upon another value in a record, these are called “Validation Rules”
Finally, how to create a formula field where you expose a field from the account object to a child object, in this case, the opportunity
{}Require a field on a page layout:{}
Now I am going to show you some simple features you can use in your salesforce configuration to ensure accurate quality data entry by your end users.
Our first recommended configuration step is to make sure you set fields to required if they should be entered when a new record is created.
This is a very simple configuration.
Gear Icon > Setup Home > Objects & Fields > Object Manager > Account > Page Layouts > Edit page layout > Edit a field to show how it is made required (explain how this improves data quality but not to go overboard with it)
{}Validation Rules:{}
Next, I want to take you through the process of creating a validation rule.
In this case, I want to make sure that if a sales representative is marking an opportunity as “Closed Lost”, they fill in the custom field we have created for the Closed Lost Reason.
Opportunities Tab > Open existing opportunity.
Show that you cannot make an opportunity Closed Lost unless you have the field “Loss Code” populated with a loss reason.
Gear Icon > Setup Home > Objects & Fields > Object Manager > Opportunity > Validation Rules > Edit rule “Closed Loss Rule“ and explain briefly how it was set up.
{}Formula Field:{}
Finally, let me show you a useful tip on how to display a key field from the Account object down to the child record like the Opportunity without the user having to enter the data in the Opportunity.
-View Opportunity record and show Account Type field
Setup:
- Gear Icon > Setup Home > Objects & Fields > Object Manager > Opportunity > Fields > select New > select a formula field > Type Text field > Next
-Use the advanced formula screen > Insert field, select the Account object with the carrot and then select the Type field.
-Use TEXT Text function to convert the picklist to a text value – here is the formula:
Text(Account.Type )

Select the best way to train your users
{}Speaker1:{}
One of the most important things you and your team can do is establish a training program for your users.
You will need to emphasize the value of training, develop the process you’ll use to deliver training, create your training materials and plans and ensure your management teams support your training program.
Set the stage
Answer “{}What's in it for me?{}”
Tell your users what they can expect from Salesforce and what is expected of them.
Be clear to users how success is measured
Establish “{}If it isn't in Salesforce, it does not exist{}”
{}Speaker1:{}
Your training strategy will include the training objectives and delivery schedule.
It should also include insight into your business objectives and value.
Start with helping your users understand what is expected of them and what they can expect in turn.
{}<animation1>{}Your executive and management teams should drive home the message that “if doesn’t exist in salesforce it doesn’t exist”.
This will help users understand that data quality and completeness is a priority.
{}<animation2>{} Help them understand what metrics are being used by their managers in salesforce to measure success.
{}<animation3>{} And Make sure you sell the value of what users will achieve with salesforce by articulating the “What’s in it for me” for the end user.
If you make it easy for your users to use your solution, establish clear expectations, provide insight into benefits to the business, and explain “what’s in for me” then you have set the stage for success.

<size val="2000">{}Step 1</size><size val="1800"> </size>{}
Identify your audience
{}Speaker1:{}
Here are 3 steps to consider when planning your training:
{}<animation1>{}First, you need to identify your audience
{}<animation2>{}Second, determine relevant user scenarios specific to your audience
{}<animation3>{}And third, define the types of training you will offer, and when and how they will be delivered
Let’s discuss in more detail.
Identify your audience
Who needs to be trained?
What processes are relevant for the audience?
What scenarios are covered by Salesforce?
Key Questions:
Activity Tracking
Reports & Dashboards
Sales Process
Account & Contact Management
{}Training Areas{}
{}Sales Rep{}
{}Sales Manager{}
{}Executive{}
Leads Process
{}Speaker1:{}
Knowing your audience is critical to the success of training.
Different kinds of users will have distinct goals and perform different tasks in Salesforce.
Focus your training based on their role and create training scenarios that are relevant to their day to day.
For example, (1) train your management team separate from your end users, since they will interact with the application in very different ways.
Determine your scenarios
Prep for meeting with prospect – review account, contact and activity history
Capture meeting outputs – update opportunity and set follow-up activities
Use Salesforce1 to capture the information when on the road
<font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}SAMPLE</font><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans Light&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans Light&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{} “{}Day in the Life{}” Sales Rep Scenario:</font>
{}Speaker1:{}
Your training will be more effective if you include scenarios.
These are typical processes your users will go through on a daily basis using Salesforce.
Here is an example of a scenario for a sales representative as they go through their day.
Our sales representative is meeting with a prospective customer.
Your training will show them how to use Salesforce to look up relevant information to prep for the meeting.
Once the meeting ends, it will include steps on how to capture meeting outputs, like updating an open opportunity and scheduling a follow up task.
Also, if the sales rep is on the road, walk through how they can perform the same activities using the Salesforce1 mobile application.

{}Self Paced Training{}
{}In Person Training{}
{}Ad Hoc Meetings{}
{}Speaker1:{}
Here is an example of an ideal training path for your sales representatives.
{}<animation1>{}First, we utilize the basic Getting Started modules from salesforce to familiarize your users with the system and learn the terminology.
These self paced courses can be helpful as pre-requisite training before attending live training.
{}<animation2>{} Next is in-person training where you go through real business processes in your salesforce solution.
Create training in shorter sessions to keep focused on a specific scenario or topic.
If applicable,  h<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;dk1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">ave users enter “real” data not just test data.
Communicate in advance that they should come prepared to training with information they want to enter.</fill-sd>
{}<animation1>{} Finally, do ad hoc follow-up training sessions to provide ongoing training based on feedback provided from your users.
These can be done as brown bags, web-based meetings, emails or in person sessions.

Our salesforce administrators need to develop strategies to make the most use of their time.
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;dk1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Here are some of the top tips to </fill-sd><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;000000&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">m</fill-sd>aximize your admin time and minimize your training time with users.
First, salesforce releases new versions three times a year.
Build time into your training program to review the new release and provide training to your end users as needed for new features you wish to enable.
Second, use Chatter to communicate self serve training materials to your end users
Third, develop a train the trainer program so key users take ownership of training new users within their work groups
Fourth, training should happen throughout the year so build an ongoing training process for new users and for existing users.
And finally, develop a process to track end user training.
This way, you can refer users back to the training plan if they missed a step or have questions.
Salesforce Administrators:
Drive your own career
Salesforce Certification
Get trained and certified
Join a local User Group
Leverage the Success Community to learn from your peers
{}Speaker1:{}
Investing in your administrator is the best way to ensure success.
Here are a few suggestions on how to get educated and stay connected.
{}<animation1>{}  Get trained and certified as a salesforce administrator.
There are a number of self-paced training classes are available within the help and training portal at no additional charge.
A popular course is called “Getting Started:
Administering Salesforce”.
We also offer comprehensive instructor led training courses regionally and virtually at an additional cost.
Afterward, take the exam to earn your salesforce certification.
{}<animation2>{}  Visit our Salesforce University page to learn more about certification.
{}<animation3>{} We also encourage you to join a local user group.
These groups are run by customers who want to network and connect with customers, partners, and administrators in their area.
Look for a local user group near you within the success community.
{}<animation4>{}And join other groups within the Success Community to get connected and learn from salesforce experts.
Support, engage, and motivate your users
{}Speaker1:{}
After users are trained, the next step is to support them, keep them engaged and drive adoption.
The methods you emphasize will naturally depend on your organization’s unique culture.
Let’s talk through some examples.
Drive User Adoption
Executive leadership
Emphasize the value
Motivate by recognition
Develop incentives
{}Motivate{}
{}Support{}
{}Engage{}
Utilize super users
Document your support process and share
Address problems quickly and publicly
Offer refresher training
Develop a communication plan
Create feedback loops
Reach out to resistors
Utilize Chatter
Walk the floor
{}Speaker1:{}
What motivates your users will be unique to your organization but there are common themes we want to share to help drive end user adoption.
{}<animation1>{}
Motivating the team is led by management, and the executive sponsor needs to be engaged throughout the deployment, not just at the beginning.
Keep them involved and communicating the value of using salesforce.
This is a big factor for success.
Continue to articulate the “what’s in it for me” to your users.
As your deployment evolves and you introduce new features or enhancements, each should include the value for the end user.
Some users are very motivated by recognition.
Use adoption dashboards to create a Hall of Fame and highlight users who are actively logging into Salesforce.
Other users are motivated by rewards.
Think about user contests or other ways to provide incentives.
{}<animation2>{}
Once users are live on salesforce, you should develop a support process to provide users a way to get help and ask questions.
Develop and utilize your super users.
These users understand the business processes and are passionate about the value of using salesforce.
Make them an extension of you and a resource to help other users with questions.
Create, document and communicate a support process for your users so they know who to contact and when.
If you have Premier, think about exposing your premier passcode and support number to your users right on the home page and extending that support channel to them.
Level set with your users that is purely for technical help.
Address issues or problems quickly and publically.
Communicate to your users if an issue is discovered, and share when the issue is resolved.
Finally, offer ongoing training and use the frequently asked questions from your support process to identify the topics for training.
We recommend small informal sessions and consider recording and posting them in a shared library based on topic.
{}<animation3>{}
And continue to connect and engage with your users.
Develop and share your ongoing communication plan including upcoming training sessions, milestones, or functional roadmap items you have based on feedback received.
Create a feedback loop so when you receive a suggestion, you have a way to share progress and priority.
We discussed resistors in our first session, who are those users that resist change.
They have great information to share to improve your solution, reach out to them.
We recommended the user of a chatter group to communicate and collect feedback during the launch of salesforce, but utilize this ongoing.
It’s a great way to engage with users within salesforce.
And finally, walk the floor and sit with your users as they are performing their day to day tasks.
Watching go through the motions will help you understand what is working and what is not working.
Best Practice:
Use Chatter to accelerate training and adoption
{}Training{}
Use Groups to consolidate training materials

Reinforce from your executives – provide <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />a forum to champion <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />the implementation
Increase transparency
Celebrate achievements
Showcase super users, MVP’s or early adopters
On-board and mentor employees
{}Speaker1:{}
As we shared earlier, Chatter is a great tool to help deliver training and an environment for engagement
{}<animation1>{}
We recommend using a Chatter to make training easier to deliver and to give users a place to ask questions, participate in conversations and provides an announcement capability to your trainers.
Use Chatter to:
Consolidate training materials
House training schedules and announcements
Connect your users
Provide a space for conversations
Share best practices and how to’s
{}<animation2>{}
Use Chatter as a tool for feedback and user engagement with you and each other
Chatter provides a method for executives to reinforce the value
Chatter provides transparency to crucial information in the application
It allows you to celebrate company, team and individual achievements
And you can also on-board and mentor new employees into your company with Chatter
Creating a Chatter group is an effective way to share important dates and deadlines, provides a central place to store training documents, and allow users to share feedback.
It is the single easiest way to provide a training and feedback environment right in the application for your users.

Track and measure success
{}Speaker2:{}
Part of your implementation plan is how to measure the success of your deployment when you Go Live with your users.
Let’s go into more detail and discuss the tools that will help you.
Best Practice:
Measure Salesforce usage
Adoption Dashboards from the AppExchange
Salesforce usage is a valuable metric for measuring success
{}Success Indicators:{}
Login rates
What data are they creating/updating?
{}Suggestions:{}
Opportunities created, last 30 days
Activities completed, last 30 days
Login rates, last 7 days
Users who haven’t logged in, last 7 days
{}Speaker2:{}
Once users are active on salesforce, usage metrics can provide value and insight into how users are interacting with the system.
Some early indicators of success include login rates and record creation or updates.
Login rates tracks how often users are logging in to salesforce, and record creation or record updates give you insight if users are interacting with the data.
{}<animation1> {}Your success metrics will differ depending on the expected behavior of your users, but here are a few suggested metrics to track:
- How many opportunities have been created in the last 30 days?
- How many activities were completed in the last 30 days?
- What is our login rate over the last 7 days?
- Who is logging in and, more importantly, who is not logging in and why?
Build out your adoption dashboards based on the expected pattern of usage you are aiming for and review these metrics at least once a month.
If you see usage is not progressing like you had hoped, it could be a sign that users need more assistance.
Perhaps additional training is necessary, or some users may need more one on one training if they are struggling.
Remember, you do not need to start from scratch.
Visit the appexchange and download the adoption dashboards which will provide metrics around usage and data creation.
{}<animation2> {}We will include a link to this dashboard in the resource file located below this video.
Best Practice:
Measure data quality
Salesforce Data Quality Dashboards from the AppExchange
Data quality is a valuable metric for measuring adoption
{}Examples:{}
Account Data Quality
Opportunities Data Quality
Missing Account Data
Sales Reps Opportunity Quality Scores
{}Speaker2:{}
Good data quality is another way to measure adoption.
Here are some examples of what you can track and the value of keeping an eye on this data.
During training, you emphasized the need to capture non-required key fields, however the dashboard is showing that a low percentage of those fields are completed.
Are users confused on what to do?
Did they miss the importance of capturing these data fields?
If you have data that is not progressing as expected, such as opportunities stuck in the same sales stage for too long or open deals with a close dates in the past, then users are not maintaining their data which tells you there is a problem.
Are there too many clicks?
Is data hard to find?
Are you unclear on the sales process?
Was there an assumption a process would be followed but there is no mandate to do so?
Having visibility into the data allows you to be proactive to uncover blockers that are impacting adoption.
Use this insight to help users
overcome challenges.
Visit the Appexchange and review the data quality dashboards available.
There are several, including Account and Opportunity data quality.
We will share the link to these dashboards in our resources deck directly below this video.
Best Practice:
Assess User Satisfaction
Survey tools on the AppExchange
User feedback will help you drive adoption
Are your end users finding Salesforce easy to use?
Are Sales Managers managing their teams more effectively?
Are Sales Reps finding content faster?
The appexchange has tools for surveys, check them out!
{}Speaker2:{}
After you have your usage and data quality analysis, the next step is to assess user satisfaction.
This type of measurement is usually done through a survey or formal business process review.
This direct feedback from users can help you understand if the pain points and business objectives are being realized.
This is a fast way for you to get feedback and make adjustments to your Salesforce solution as needed.
For our smaller organizations, you can explore using a Chatter group for feedback and consider creating some chatter polls to get insight.
Be sure to explore the AppExchange to review third party survey tools available.
Track achievement of business outcomes
{}Speaker2:{}
Are you achieving the business outcomes you had targeted?
Here is an example:
For a sales-driven company this may relate to the length of the sales cycle or win rates.
It is up to each individual company to decide which metrics they want to measure and which they are able to measure to understand how salesforce is affecting their business.
Let’s talk about some steps you can take to build these metrics in Salesforce.
What should you do now?
Start the discussion with your stakeholders
Implement the strategy
Build dashboards that highlight your <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;002044&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />key metrics
Start driving performance with actionable <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;002044&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />data and dashboards!
Need a jumpstart?
Use the AppExchange
{}Speaker2:{}
So, where do you start?
If you haven’t already, use the business objectives and key metrics outlined in your Getting started workbook to guide your conversations with your stakeholders.
Schedule a meeting to review and discuss progress.
Implement a strategy around how to track achievements.
Remember, adoption and measurement will evolve over time, but you want to make sure you are tracking progress and taking action on insights to optimize your salesforce deployment.
Start simple but build out some key reports and dashboards and review them with management for feedback.
Make sure the reports and dashboards highlight actionable data so everyone sees the value.
And use the appexchange dashboard packs to get a jump start.

The Getting Started Workbook has worksheets and examples to help you identify your business metrics.
Tailor the worksheet to document what is important to your company.
Outline key questions you want to answer, then associated it with a metric you can track in salesforce.
This gives you an action plan for the metrics you need to create.
Be sure to review the salesforce standard reports as well as the prebuilt dashboards on the AppExchange to help you build them.
Reports and Dashboards available on the AppExchange
100+ more reports and dashboards from partners to explore as you expand and grow your business.
Salesforce CRM Dashboards
Sales Activity Dashboards
Service and Support Dashboards
Salesforce Mobile Dashboard for iPad
{}Speaker2:{}
We’ve introduced the Adoption and Data quality dashboards available on the appexchange, but there are more.
These best practice dashboards were built by salesforce experts to help customers get visibility into common metrics tracked across our customer base.
Examples include
Salesforce CRM Dashboards, which includes Sales, Service, and Marketing dashboards
Sales Activity Dashboards
and mobile dashboards for your Ipad
Let’s share some best practices as you consider downloading these AppExchange dashboard packs:
You have the option to install the dashboard in your sandbox environment or in a developer org.
This will let you explore prior to installing in your production instance.
You have full control to customize these dashboards and the underlying reports to meet your business needs.
You can even delete if they do not fit your needs.
And finally, once the dashboards are ready, communicate the availability to your stakeholders for their review and feedback.
You may consider informal training sessions so people know how to use them.
Validate your solution
Ensure user adoption by testing their experience.
Is your training preparing your users?
Does your feedback process create engagement and trust?
Do your users feel supported?
Are you measuring the right <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />business outcomes?
{}Speaker2:{}
Throughout our Getting started series, we’ve recommended that you validate your design and customizations with end users.
Continue this best practice to validate your training, support and engagement processes with end users as well.
Are you meeting your user’s needs?
Do they feel supported?
In addition, you will want to validate that the business dashboards you created meet their needs as well.
Make sure you do this validation and testing to drive a successful rollout.

*The reports tool is a data analytics tool available in the marketing cloud.
The reports tool allows you to easily measure multiple campaigns and their success.*
*It also provides a larger perspective on multichannel strategies delivering additional insights into what’s happening with all your digital communications.*
*The reports tool is simple to use.
And it delivers real time detailed results of your data from your marketing campaigns.
It also provides a wide variety of report types that best feature needs.*
*There are three types of reports that are available in the reports tool:
Standard, Custom and Discover.
You’ll learn more about each of these types of report later in this module.*
*To learn how to access the reports tool click ‘next’.*
*Click next to continue.*
*The Reports Tool can be found in the exacttarget marketing cloud.
To access the Reports tool you will click on Reports in the Marketing cloud app switcher.*
*You will then be taken to overview page.
On the overview page there will be three ways to access every report.*
*You can click on catalog in the tool bar or if you defined the specific report as a shortcut, you can click on that specific report.*
*You can also access a category of reports via the report catalog area.
The report catalog area will list all the reports categories available in you account.*
*In this account we have custom reports, discover reports, email reports as well as mobile connect and social pages reports. *
*The workspace below will display all of the report perimeter definitions that you have saved when creating reports in the past.*
*The very left hand side will allow you to filter those reports for quick and easy access.*
*The reports tool offers 3 types of reports:
Standard, Custom and Discover reports.*
*Each comes with various features and functionality that provides tailored options to review the data needed for your marketing campaigns.
Standard reports are available on all accounts.*
*The Custom and Discover reports are available for an additional cost.
Now let’s take a deeper dive into the different report types.*
*Click on the report type to review more information about each one.
Then, click ‘next’ to continue.*
*Standard reports allow you to access new and legacy reports previously run in each channel application.*
*All standard reports for the email application, mobile connect and social pages are available in the reports tool, making it easy to run any report from a single tool.*
*The report catalogue area on the overview page will list the channel applications available on your account and the number of reports associated with the channel.*
*In this example there are 41 standard email reports, 5 mobile connect reports, and 3 standard social pages reports.*
*Welcome to the ‘Reports Tool Overview’ module.*
*A standard report is a document that contains statistics or data usually over a period of time.
The layout and the standard information that will be included in the report are defined and cannot be altered.*
*When you run a standard report, you will specify certain report parameters.
Report parameters can vary depending on the report being run.*
*For example when running the campaign ‘Email Tracking’ report, you will need to specify the date range, a specific campaign, exclusions, time zone and the date format.*
*While the account ‘Send Summary’ has you specify, the date range, exclusions, time zone and date format.*
*Custom reports are created upon request.*
*These reports are viewable in the catalogue and are created when our Standard or Discover reports do not provide the information based on your specific use case.*
*In most cases the Premium reporting solution Discover will provide the data necessary as well as the flexibility to create a report based on your specific needs.*
*Discover is a premium reporting tool that gives immediate views into your marketing metrics.*
*Discover lets you control the report presentation and content, delivering speed of thought insights into crosstab PivotTable style reports.*
*It also has a rich interactive visualization based on data that is refreshed daily.*
*Congratulations!
You’ve just completed the ‘Reports Tool Overview’ lesson.*
*In this lesson you’ll learn what the reports tool is and why use the reports tool.
You’ll also learn how to access reports and the different types of reports that are available.
Click ‘next’ to get started.*
*What is a report?
A report provides you aggregate information about subscribers, sending, and other aspects of your email, mobile connect, mobile push or social pages applications.*
*There are three types of reports:
Standard, Custom and Discover.
Standard reports are available on all accounts.
Custom reports are being created specifically for your needs and Discover is our premium reporting tool.*
*If you’d like to learn more about discover, please take the online discover course. *
*Today we’re going to create a standard report in which case we will define the parameters for the report such as the date range, date format, and time zone.
Click ‘next’ to continue. *
*In this interactive simulation, you will create the campaign ‘Email Tracking’ report.*
*Congratulation, you’ve now completed the ‘How to Create a Report’ lesson.*
*To create a report you will navigate to ‘Reports’.
Reports can be found in the marketing cloud app switcher.
Click ‘Reports’.*
*To create a new report, you will navigate to the report catalogue from the ‘overview’ page.
The report catalogue is where all reports can be found.*
*The reports that will be listed in the catalogue will depend on the channel applications that are enabled on your account.*
*This account has email, mobile connect, social pages, and Discover enabled.*
*Therefore all email reports, both Custom as well as Standard, all mobile connect, social pages, and Discover reports are available in the report catalogue.*
*You can navigate to the report catalogue three different ways.
First, you can click on ‘catalogue’ in the toolbar.*
*The catalogue then will display every report available in your account.
You can also access a specific report in the shortcut area.*
*The most efficient way to access the report catalogue is via the ‘report catalogue’ area.*
*In the report catalogue area you will select the category and only the reports for that particular channel will appear.
To access a standard email report, click on ‘email’.*
*The report catalogue will now display all email reports.
You’ll notice that there are both Standard reports as well as Discover reports, and Custom email reports can also be found in the workspace.*
*To find a specific report we can use the filter area in the left-hand panel.
Filters allow us to set criteria for the type of report, and then only those reports meeting that specific criteria will appear.*
*In our case, we are going to filter for just Standard email reports.
Click the ‘standard’ checkbox.*
*In this scenario, you want to see how your birthday email campaign has been performing for the past seven days.*
*You’ll locate the campaign email tracking report, and then to create a report click on the ‘create’ button for the campaign email tracking report.*
*In the ‘create report’ dialogue box you are ready to begin to find the parameters for the report.
The first parameter is the date range.*
*To select a different date range click on the ‘date range’ dropdown.*
*Once again, our scenario is to see how our birthday campaign has been performing in the last seven days.
Select ‘last seven days’ from the dropdown.*
*In the next parameter, you will need to select the specific campaign to report against.
In this case it will be our birthday campaign.
Click on the select campaign ‘report against’ dropdown arrow. *
*Select the birthday program from the dropdown.*
*The next parameter is whether or not to exclude jobs where tracking is suppressed.*
*In our scenario we will leave the default ‘true’.
We will also leave the time zone, and the date format at the default for account.
Click to submit the report.*
*The campaign email tracking report now displays all the data for our birthday campaign.*
*It’s important to note that when exclude jobs where tracking is suppressed has been chosen, whether through the guided send, user initiated email, or send activity, all tracking data will be excluded from the report.*
*To save the parameters for the report, click ‘save’.*
*In the ‘save report’ dialogue box, you’ll begin by giving the report a name.
We will do this for you.
Click ‘next’ to continue.*
*Welcome to the module ‘How to Create a Report’.*
*The report’s source will automatically be populated, and the description field is an optional field.
In our scenario, we’ll leave that blank.
To save the report, click ‘save’.*
*Once the report has been successfully saved, let’s navigate back o the ‘overview’ page.
Click ‘overview’ in the toolbar.*
*The birthday program results ‘last seven days report’ definition now appears in the report’s workspace.
Click ‘next’ to continue.*
*Once the report parameters have been defined, you will run the report.*
*In this lesson, you’ll learn five ways to deliver and schedule a report.*
*The report can be saved or you can use one of the delivery or scheduling options available in the reports tool.*
*The final report option is the schedule option.
The schedule option allows you to take a report definition that has been saved and establish a recurring schedule for the report to be run.*
*The report then can be emailed, placed on an FTP or saved as a snapshot.
It’s important to note that the scheduling option is only available for reports that have been created via the reports tool.*
*Any report that’s been created via the reports tool cannot be added as a step in a program or in automation via Automation Studio.*
*To learn more about the scheduling option, click the ‘schedule’ icon.*
*In this interactive simulation, you’ll learn how to schedule a report.*
*Once the report definition has been created, you can save it and establish a recurring schedule.
In order for the ‘schedule’ icon to become active, you must first save your report definition.*
*After saving your report definition, click on the ‘schedule’ icon.*
*After clicking on the ‘schedule’ icon, the schedule report results dialogue box will appear.
The report name will be-pre populated with the name you gave the report when the report was saved.*
*The first parameter you will define is the start date.
You will click on the calendar and select a date for the schedule to start.
For our scenario, click on the 17{}th{}.*
*Once the start date has been selected, you will select a time for the report to run.
Click on the dropdown arrow to select a time.*
*From the dropdown select 7 AM as the start time.*
*If you need to select a different time zone for the report to run, click the dropdown, and then select the appropriate time zone.*
*Once you’ve established the date for the schedule to start, and a time to run the report, you’ll then select how often the report needs to be run.
Click on the dropdown.*
*You can choose to run a report once, hourly, daily, on the weekdays, weekly, monthly or yearly.
Depending on your selection, the repeat options will vary.
Select weekly.*
*When selecting the weekly option, you can run a report every week, every two weeks and so on.
We will run the report every week.*
*You will then select what day, or days of the week to run the report.
For example: you can select to run the report every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.*
*The default is Sunday.
In our example we will run the report every Monday morning.
You will begin by de-selecting Sunday.
Click on ‘Sunday’.*
*There are five options for delivering and scheduling a report.*
*To select Monday click on ‘Monday’.*
*After selecting when to run the report, you will then determine when the schedule will end.
You have two options: on date, and after.*
*The ‘after’ option will allow you to set the number of recurrences before the schedule will end.
The ‘on date’ option allows you to enter a date to stop the schedule.*
*We will select the default ‘on date’.
We will stop the program on January 1{}st{} 2015.
We will enter this for you.
Simply click in the textbox.*
*You can email the report, upload the report to the exact target and handstaff TP, download the report to your computer, save a snapshot of the report, or schedule the report to run on a recurring basis.*
*Once the schedule options have been defined, you are now ready to define the delivery options.
There are four choices for the format for this report.*
*Data file, which is the default, compressed file, and two types of Excel spreadsheets.
We are going to select an Excel spreadsheet.*
*When establishing a schedule for our report to be run, you need to determine how you wish to receive the report.*
*The report can be emailed to you, placed on the exact target and handstaff TP, or saved to the snapshot area.*
*The default is to have the report emailed.
In our scenario today, we are going to select to save the report to the snapshot area.
Click the radio button next to ‘save’ to reports.*
*To learn more about each of these options, click the icons below.
When you are finished, click ‘next’.*
*To save the schedule definitions, click ‘save’.*
*The browse re-targeting campaign last seven days report is now scheduled to run every Monday at 7AM.*
*The report will appear in the snapshot area.
Click ‘next’ to continue.*
*Congratulations, you’ve now completed the simulation!*
*One way to share the report is to email the report to yourself and others in your organization.
When selecting this option you can choose to send the email report to multiple email addresses.*
*The email addressed just need to be separated by a comma or a semicolon.
When emailing the report, there will be various file format options such as Excel spreadsheet, or CSV, or even a Zip file.*
*The format options will vary based on the report that you are emailing.
Click on the ‘email’ icon to learn more.*
*In the email report results dialogue box, you’ll begin by typing in a name for the report that will be delivered in the email.
The report source will automatically be populated by the report name, as it appears in the catalogue.*
*You will then enter in the email address, or email addressed of people you wish to send the report to.
Remember the email addresses must be separated by a semicolon or a comma.*
*You will then enter the subject line, and if you wish, you can include a note with the email.
Finally you’ll select the file format.*
*File formats will vary based on the report.
After selecting the file format, simply click save to email the report.*
*Another option for sharing and saving your report is to upload the report to a file transfer protocol site or FTP.*
*You can save your report to the exact target and handstaff TP.
The file type options will vary from report to report.*
*Click on the ‘FTP’ icon to learn more.*
*In the FTP report results dialogue box, you’ll begin by typing in a name for the report.
You will then select the exact target and handstaff TP site to place the file.*
*The report source will automatically be populated with the name of the report as it appears in the catalogue.
And finally you’ll select a file format.*
*The file formats will vary based on the report.
After selecting a file format, simply click ‘save’.*
*You can also choose to save your report directly to your computer’s hard drive.
To learn more about how to download a report, click on the ‘download’ icon.*
*In the download report results dialogue box, you will begin by typing in a name for your file.
The report source will automatically be populated by the report name as it appears in the catalogue.*
*You’ll then select the file format.
File formats will vary based on the report.
After clicking ‘save’, you will receive a confirmation message once your report has been saved to your computer.*
*The process for creating a report starts with selecting the appropriate report to run.*
*Snapshot is another option available to view your report.
When saving a report as a snapshot, you are saving that version of the report to an online file folder located in the reports tool.*
*This option is very useful for online collaboration.
For example: a group of people needs to review the ‘complaints by domain’ report every Monday morning, and compare the data to pass through ports.*
*Instead of emailing the report to everyone each week, the report can be saved as a snapshot.
People are able to see the most current version of the report in addition to any other previous snapshots that have been saved.*
*You are able to access the snapshot feature after you’ve saved your report definition.*
*After selecting the report you will define the parameters for the report.*
*In the snapshot report results dialogue box, the report name will automatically be populated for you.
You will then simply choose the format for the snapshot, and then click ‘save’.*
*To access all the snapshots that have been run for a particular report, you will navigate to the reports overview page, and locate the specific report.
You’ll then click on the name.*
*After clicking on the name of the report, you’ll be brought to this page.
On the left-hand side is information about the report.*

Once you see the response go through, take a look back in Social Studio.
Your post will show up at the top of the Engage column.
To set up an Engage tab template, go to the Workspace Settings page.
To access this page, go to the NTO Training drop-down
and click the gear icon.
This takes you to the Workspace Settings page.
Click Templates on the left hand side of the screen.
This is where any existing Engage tab templates will be.
Here you can edit any existing templates or create new ones.
To create a new one, click New Template.
This takes you to the page where you will build your new template.
Change the name of the template.
If you click the title, we will fill in the name Daily Social Tracking.
It is helpful to have a good naming convention to distinguish templates.
Since this one is for tracking daily social media posts, we will give the template that name.
Next, you can add social columns under the Build tab, or if you click Settings
You can add a description, click the Description box.
We will fill in the description of daily social tracking.
You can also set it up so this tab template automatically shows up as a tab within the Engage tool for newly added members of the workspace.
To add columns to the Engage tab template, go back to the Build tab at the top by clicking on it.
Next, click Social Account
and add the Twitter and Facebook accounts to track.
Then, click Add Social Account.
This brings up all of the posts from your Facebook and Twitter accounts.
Add another column.
Click Social Accounts again to add your Twitter and Facebook accounts.
Click Add Social Account.
Filter this new column by clicking the gear icon
and then Filter.
Here you can assign this column to whatever user is logged in and using this template.
As a reminder, this allows users to quickly view your customized template.
So that you know this column is for the posts assigned to you, it will be labeled Assigned to Me.
Click the column title.
We will fill in Assigned to Me.
Close out of the Filter panel and the columns are available for anyone to use.
Once you have named your Engage tab template, added a description, and built your columns, you would save it by clicking Create and Exit.
There is a simple way to ensure consistency across teams regarding content that each individual user is seeing and interacting with.
As new members join your team, making your Engage tab templates automatically available upon logging in is an easy way to accomplish this goal.
Under Settings in the Engage tab template, you can control if someone will automatically have certain tab templates available to them in Engage, or if they must add it on their own.
Do this by checking the Automatically Create for Newly Added Members box.
If it is checked, newly added members will have the template available to them right away in their Engage tool.
When you first sign in as a new user, the initial screen you'll see is the workspace screen.
This user has been assigned to the NTO Training workspace, so click that workspace.
Click Engage at the top of the screen.
You'll see the Engage tab template is already here to use.
You can see the columns that were created in the Engage tab template titled Daily Social Tracking, the regular social account columns, and the ones that are assigned to this user.
If you are a current user and don't have the Daily Social Tracking tab automatically available in your Engage tool, click the plus button to add a tab.
You will see your choice of templates here as well as the option to choose Blank Template and Build Your Own.
Click the Daily Social Tracking option.
Click Create Tab.
Now that tab is added to your Engage tool and shows up at the bottom of your screen.
This user has 2 posts assigned to her.
She needs to respond.
To respond to posts in the Engage tab template that has been assigned to you, click on one of the posts under Assigned to Me.
The Inspect Post panel comes up.
Click the Reply button to reply to this customer.
We will fill in the reply here.
Click Post.
You will see a reply confirmation at the top.

Click Add New under Topic Profiles.
Name the keyword group NTO Products.
Northern Trails TP
This brings up the Create Topic profile panel.
This topic profile will be about Northern Trail Outfitters, so name this topic profile
Under Type, choose Brand.
Keywords should pertain to the brand and how it is most commonly mentioned on social media.
The first keyword is NTO.
Click Done.
To add another keyword, click the plus button.
We'll add Northern Trails.
Keywords are not case sensitive, so capitalization does not matter.
Define conversations specifically about camping in the End Contains Keyword section.
Add keywords camping, tents and hiking.
You can also exclude conversations.
Say NTO is a local band, and you don't want to bring in conversations around NTO the band.
Exclude the keyword “music”.
You can also customize something called Keyword Proximity.
Click Northern Trails.
Now the words "Northern Trails" must appear right next to each other.
This is so that you don't have conversations brought in that have "Northern" in the first sentence and "Trails" in the third sentence.
Those conversations would not apply.
You can adjust this to have words in between.
For now, keep it with No Proximity.
With all the keywords filled out, click Create Keyword Group.
Filter options are Languages, Media Types, and Regions.
For Languages, deselect All Languages.
Select English and Spanish.
Click Save.
For Media Types
Deselect Aggregator and Buy and Sell.

To do this, add a source group.
And find the previously created source group or create a new one.
To find out what the Sarah Smith Facebook profile is saying about your brand, copy her Facebook link
and click Add.
Name the source group
and click Save
to add this to the topic profile.
You can share this topic profile with a specific workspace.
You can also share with multiple workspaces.
To do this, go to the Sharing tab.
This topic profile is not shared with any workspace.
Click Edit Workspaces to see the list of workspaces within our tenant.
Share it with NTO Training
and click Apply.
This is to allow Full users, Basic users and users other than Super users to use the Topic Profile in the Workspace.
Now that you have created a topic profile, you will create an analyze dashboard called a social listening summary dashboard and apply the topic profile.
Click on Analyze at the top of the page.
To create a new dashboard, click Create New.
Choose Social Listening Summary.
This is the dashboard where you can apply a topic profile.
Since you shared this topic profile with the NTO Training workspace, which you are in now, you see it in this list.
To apply this topic profile, click the check mark next to it.
Click Create Dashboard.
This will create a social listening summary dashboard with the Northern Trails topic profile.
Here you can see common social metrics around Northern Trails.
On the left, you see a feed of mentions of Northern Trails.
You have post volume and posts over time.
You have keywords, what people are saying.
You also have volume by keyword group, top countries, top languages, sentiment, and sentiment over time.
All of these metrics focus just on camping conversations and the Northern Trail Outfitters brand because you applied the Northern Trails topic profile.
To create a topic profile column in Engage, start in the Engage tool and click Add Column.
This time you will add a Topic Profile.
Here you see the list of available topic profiles within the workspace NTO Training.
Click on the Northern Trails topic profile
and click Apply.
This will bring up a column that has applied our Topic Profile.
These are all the Northern Trail Outfitters mentions around camping, hiking and tents.
Managing topic profiles through searching and sorting is simple.
You have a long list of topic profiles within your workspace.
To pull up the Northern Trails topic profile you can search to find it.
You can also sort topic profiles.
Click on Name to sort in alphabetical order,
Click again to show reverse order.
You can also sort by Owner.
EMV,
or Status.
As a super user, I can see all the topic profiles available within this tenant in the Admin and Topic Profiles view.
You can see here there are five different topic profiles within this tenant.
If I log in to the account of a full user,
I can only see three topic profiles.
That is because a full user can only see the topic profiles that are shared with them.
If I click into this Northern Trails topic profile,
I can see all the information,
but I'm not able to edit any of it.
Only the super user can do that.
If you are a full user you can edit any topic profiles that you have created yourself.
As a full user you can apply the topic profiles that have been shared with your workspace to a dashboard or to an Engage column.
