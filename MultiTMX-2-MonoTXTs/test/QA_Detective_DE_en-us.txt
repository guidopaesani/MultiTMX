{}Key Terms{}
Key Terms
Here are some important key terms for you to understand in order to successfully complete this training.
Let’s begin with the Call to Action or CTA – the call to action convinces the consumer to take action.
It is what prompts a consumer taking action or beginning a conversation with you via their mobile device.
Common call to actions might be a print add, promotion, ad on the radio or TV, billboards, newspapers, and more.  the wording on the graphic that states Text NTOROX to 12345 to sign up for mobile offers & receive…is the call to action
A keyword, is simply a word for someone to text in to join a specific campaign.
In this sign, NTOROX is the keyword.
A short code is a phone number that can be shared or randomly generated, or private and personally chosen by you.
This is the number that the mobile device user will text the keyword to
The call to action should have an incentive – in other words, what’s in it for me?
What benefit does the consumer receive by texting NTOROX to 12345?
In this case, Free Snow Gloves.
Finally, it is a good idea to add Legal Copy print materials.
{}MobileConnect Templates{}
There are ten available templates in MobileConnect.
Each template is the blueprint for a campaign that you can execute in the system.
The template walks you through everything that you need to do to configure & activate each text campaign.
*Available templates vary by edition of MobileConnect

Here is how this course will work.
There are six different lessons available to you.
Two of the lessons, the overview and data lessons are required.
They both have important information that you need to know about.
Four of the lessons are optional.
You get to choose.
If you are an administrator, you have the option of taking the administration lesson.
If you are interested in learning about the email opt-in template, you can view that lesson only, or, if you want to view all six lessons, feel free.
It's totally up to you.
This is the overview lesson.
Be sure to complete this one.
In this lesson, you will learn the definition of Mobile Connect, important key terms will be shared.
We'll talk about the templates available within Mobile Connect.
We'll share the Mobile Connect 101 course scenario and finally end with a tour of the Mobile Connect application.
What is the definition of Mobile Connect?
Mobile Connect is an application that allows you to create, send, receive and track mobile messages.
Mobile Connect can be used to create, track and manage text keywords, send SMS and MMS messages to contacts,
and it helps you automatically respond and manage incoming SMS and MMS messages, and much, much more.
You should know that you can send and receive messages using short codes within the United States,{}or using a short or long code within other countries around the world.
Here are some important key terms for you to understand in order to successfully complete this training.
Let's begin with the Call To Action or CTA.{}The Call To Action convinces the consumer to take action.
It's what prompts them to begin the conversation with you via their mobile device.
Common Call To Actions might be a print ad, promotion, ad on the radio or TV, billboards, newspapers and more.
The wording on the graphic that states Text “NTO Rocks” to 12345 to sign up for mobile offers and receive, is the call to action.
A key word is simply a word for someone to text in to join a specific campaign.
In this sign, “NTO Rocks” is the keyword.
A short code is a phone number that could be shared,{}or randomly generated or private and personally chosen by you.
This is the number that the mobile device user will text the keyword to.
The Call To Action should have an incentive.
In other words, what's in it for me?
What benefit does a consumer receive by texting “NTO Rocks” to 12345?
In this case, free snow gloves.
Finally, it's a good idea to add legal copy to your print materials.
Available templates vary by edition of MobileConnect
There are 10 templates available to you when using Mobile Connect.
The templates are very helpful because they act as a blueprint for the different types of mobile campaigns that you're building.
Each template walks you through everything you need to do to configure and activate each mobile campaign.
Hover over the different template icons to learn more about each template type.

Introduction
Welcome to the MobileConnect 101 Data Lesson.
In this lesson, we will take a close look at how data is managed when using mobileconnect.
{}STOP!{}
Data for MobileConnect is managed in Contact Builder.
If you haven’t taken the Contact Builder course, you will find it in the full course catalog on the same website you found this course.

STOP!
before we get started…it’s important for you to know that there is a course that explains the data model that is used with MobileConnect called Contact Builder.
If you are new  or existing MobileConnect user, it is important that you take the Contact Builder course to learn more about this new method of storing data.
You will find the course in the full course catalog on the same website you found this course.

Components of Data
Data is very important when using mobileconnect.
It can be used to filter lists, identify message recipients,  be used to populate messages that are relevant to the person receiving them and much much more.
There are 3 components to mobileconnect data

Let’s begin by taking a closer look at Contacts
mob-cnx.png
{}{}Contact{}:{}
{}A person who has interacted with your company via a mobile product.{}
{}Contacts{}
Your data is composed of Contacts
SUBSCRIBE
Thank you for your interest
Untitled Slide
Your data is composed of “Contacts”.
In other words, a contact is a person who has either opted-in to receive mobile communications from you or a contact is a person who has interacted with your company via a mobile product.
Simply put, it is an mobile phone number that you are sending a message to or a mobile phone number that you’ve received a message from!
In the application, you will be able to import data that consists of contacts and their personal profile information.
This data will be used in mobile message campaigns to send timely and relevant communications.
{}Where do Contacts Live?{}
All contacts live in Contact Builder for the mobile applications.
MobileConnect Contacts live in the MobileConnect System Defined Data Extensions.
Untitled Slide
So you might ask, where do contacts live?
All contacts live in Contact Builder for the mobile applications - again, if you haven’t taken the Contact Builder course, you should do so.
MobileConnect contacts live in the mobileconnect system defined data extensions that are pictured here, the MobileConnect Demographics and the MobileConnect Subscriptions data extensions.
When your account is provisioned with . MobileConnect, these system defined data extensions are added to your account – you don’t have to do any of the work!
These contain system information that is necessary for you to successfully send mobile messages.
You also have the ability to create custom fields to collect, store, and utilize as well when sending your mobile messages.
These fields are called attributes.
data1.png
{}Attributes{}
Attributes
Attributes are a very important part of MobileConnect, let’s take a closer look
grid-bkgd-plain.png
{}{}Ted, a Contact{}{}
{}Attributes{}
Mobile Phone
Locale
First Name
Gender
Loyalty Points
Contact Key
Untitled Slide
An attribute is data about the Contact.
Mobile Phone number is a required attribute in the MobileConnect application.
So, each contact can not exist in the application without a Mobile Phone number attribute value.
Since mobile Phone number is required, it makes sense that mobile phone number is the default unique identifier within the Mobile Connect.
A unique identifier is the item that identifies a contact in the system.
Each unique ID can only exist one time and all data about an individual contact is stored on that unique identifier -- data like profile attributes, tracking results, message history, and more.
grid-bkgd-plain.png
{}Attributes{}
There are two types of Attributes.

Attributes created based on your specific need</rpr id="47" transform="close">
{}Contacts{}
Untitled Slide
There are two types of attributes in mobile connect,
system defined attributes and custom attributes
a system attribute is data about a contact that is either required or provided automatically by mobileconnect.
As a reminder, these attributes live on the 2 system generated mobileconnect data extensions that live in Contact builder.
custom attributes are those attributes that you create based on a specific need you may have.
Maybe you want to collect and utilize contact title, region, city or favorite outdoor sport in your mobile campaigns.
Totally up to you, you can build any attributes you may need.
Just remember that they are built and managed in Contact Builder.
grid-bkgd-plain.png
{}Attributes{}
These are REQUIRED Attributes, meaning they must be populated for each Contact on the file you are importing.
M<rpr id="48">{}obile Number{}
</rpr id="48" transform="close">{}P{}hone number of the mobile device
Lo<rpr id="48">{}cale{}
{}T</rpr id="48" transform="close">h{}is is the country code of the mobile number

{}C</rpr id="52" transform="close">{}on<rpr id="48">{}tact Key{}
{}If</rpr id="48" transform="close"> {}you are using Contact Key as the Unique Identifier for your Contacts, a Contact Key is required for each Contact.
Untitled Slide
It’s important to note that there are required attributes when using mobileconnect.
This means, that they must be populated for each contact on the file you are importing or the contact will not be imported to the system.
The required attributes are:
Mobile Number – the phone number of the mobile device
Locale – the country code of the mobile number, for example United States is US, UK is GB, australia is AU and brazil is BR
and if you use the subscriber key functionality in the email application, then a contact key is required for each contact in mobile connect
{}How can attributes be used?{}
Personalize the Content of the mobile message
• Personalization Strings
Target a specific segment of contacts
• Segmentation

Attributes can be used in two ways:
1.  to personalize the content of the mobile message – you can insert personalization strings in a message so the content is specific to the contact.
Relevant communications should always been your goal sending messages, whether email or mobile, and attributes help you make this happen
2.
You can also target a specific segment of contacts  using segmentation.
Attribues can be used to filter a list so that those who live in Florida, receive a message with a coupon for sandals, and those who live in Alaska receive a message with a coupon for snow shoes.
Again relevance is key to affective communications and attributes help make this happen!

Welcome to our weekly newsletter!
Two Types of Lists
A list is a collection of contacts that can be sent to in an outbound message campagin.
You can send to a list or suppress a list at the time of send.  so it’s true, a list can be a sending list or a suppression list.
While the contacts data  is stored in Contact Builder, Lists are created within the MobileConnect application.
Also, you will import contacts and their data to the lists from within mobileConnect.
Then, by default, and behind the scenes, the imported contacts and their data will be added to the mobileConnect system data extensions that live in Contact Builder.

Standard Lists
A standard list is a list of contacts compiled as a result of one or many imports or contacts who have been manually added directly into MobileConnect.
Again, remember, contacts and their data are added in MobileConnect…but this information really lives in Contact Builder.  so think of mobileconnect as the gateway for contact information to ultimately be stored in Contact Builder.
In fact, the best way to understand this concept is to see it in action!

Filtered Lists
A filtered list is a subset of mobile contacts that live in contact builder.
The contacts can be filtered and added to a list using contact attributes that are stored on the mobileconnect system data extensions in contact builder.
But the most amazing thing is, that because the attribute data is stored in Contact builder, data from other channels can also be used in filtering lists.
Data Extensions that are created and managed in the email application are viewable within contact builder, so email attribute data can be used in conjunction with mobile attribute data to create a filtered list.
That is the power of the contact builder model!
Let’s see the creation of a filtered list in action!

Attributes
Click
Here we are in the Contact Builder application.
Remember it is accessed from the Marketing Cloud using the Data and analytics tab.
In the upper left corner, you can see that we are in the data designer area of Contact Builder
Notice the different attribute groups that are available or have been created for this account.  There are email data, mobilepush data, mobileconnect attribute groups and more.
stored within each group are corresponding data tables…some system generated and some created by users of the account
Click
In order to create an attribute to be used with the MobileConnect application, we need to click on the mobileconnect attribute group
Click the Opt Out Date list item
then, the View and Edit button that is found within the attribute group
Click the Created with Raphaël 2.1.0 diagram
Here are the two system data tables that are created by default when your account is provisioned for MobileConnect.
They are the MobileConnect Demographic table that contains attribute information like CarrierID, Channel, Contact ID, Locale and more
and the mobileconnect subscription tablel that contains keyword, mobile number, optin date and  more
You can use these attributes if you would like, some of them are required in order to have mobileconnect funtion properly, but the great thing is, you can add custom attributes to the Demographics table and use them to send relevant messages, or to create filtered lists.
Click
To create an attribute, we’ll simply hover over the top of the MobileConnect demographics data extension.  when the editing tools appear, we need to cick on the small pencil icon to be taken to the next step.
Click
once we’re in the mobileconnect demographics data extension, all we have to do is click create attribute in the upper right corner.
Type Region
Here is the box where the actual attribute creation takes place
First we need to give our attribute a name – and we’re creating the Region attribute, so that will be added here
Click
Next, we need to identify the data type – in other words, what kind of data will we  be storing for the Region attribute.
There are many options, like number, date, boolean, email address and more,
for region – we will use the text data type
Type 20
the Length value box refers to the number of characters of the data.
For us, 20 is fine – we’ll probably never have a value length that exceed 20.
Click the Create button
We could make this attribute the primary key, or the unique value of the data extension,  add a default value if needed, assign a data source, and make the attribute required.
We will just leave these values as is, and click create
Click
the region attribute now appears in the list.
It is now an attribute we can use in our MobileConnect campaigns!
List Creation
Click
to create a list, we click on the arrow next to Manage and then Contacts
Click
This is the contacts workspace.  at the top, there is an all contacts tab and a lists tab.  by default, the all contacts page is displayed. and information about our contacts is shown.  we see  contact key, mobile number, email address if we know it,  source, modified date an more
to continue creating a list, we need to click on the lists tab
Click the Create List button
and here is the lists workspace.
Once we create our list, it will be seen here in the workspace with information such as list name, contact cocunt, list type, created modified, status and more
To move forward in the list creation process, we’ll select create list
Click
In this create list dialog box, we need to specify the method by which the list will be built.
Since we are going to upload a list from a computer desktop, we’ll select the create from file radio button and then click ok to move on
Click the Browse… button
the progress bar at the top identifies that there there are 4 steps in the import contacts process.
In step one is to upload a file, step two, a short code and keyword are selected, step 3 is the configure mapping stage, and step 4 is where the process is reviewed and saved.
we are in step one of the process.
It’s here, that the file to upload is selected.
By clicking Browse, we will be taken to the desktop where we can choose the appropriate file to upload.
In our case, we will upload the NTOcontacts.csv file.
Double-Click
here it is, the NTO Contacts file, we will select the file
Click
and then click the I agree checkbox to ensure that the application knows that the individuals on the list have given us permission to send them mobile messages
Click
here we see the file upload is complete
Click the text box
Now we’ve moved onto step 2 of the process.
We need to choose a short code and keyword that we want to associate with the new contacts.
we’ll  choose the short code 59545 and keyword NTO Daily
Click
In step 3, the mapping is configured.
In othere words, it here  hat the column headers s found on the spreadsheet will be mapped , to the appropriate attributes that live on the mobileconnect data extensions housed within contact builder
there are three options – map by header row, by ordinal or manually.  b ecause the file we are importing has column headers that are similar to the attribute names in the system, we will choose to map manually
Click
On the left, we can see the headers that were found on the NTOContacts file we are importing.  and on the right, we see the attributes that are available or that have been created in the contact builder.
Using the drop down arrows, we can map the appropriate spreadsheet headers to attributes within contact builder.
Click
Now, we can see that all of the columns on the spreadsheet are mapped appropriately to the attributes in the system.
Mobile number to mobile number
Locale is mapped to locale
contact key to contact key
even the region column is mapped to the custom attribute we created region
so now, step 3 is complete
Click the Save & Build button
in step 4, we will review the import information and then choose save and build to move on
Click
in the save as dialog box, we’ll give our list a name – the name for this list is Daily Deals mobile message
and then we’ll make sure the correct list format is selected.
In this case, the standard format radio button is what we’ll choose and then we’ll click save to move on
Click
Here is the list information – there are 5 rows of data
we can look at the individual contacts by clicking ont he contacts tab
Click the MobileConnect Lists link
here are the records -
we can see the data that we have on the contacts.  like mobile number source modified date and channel
to view the lists workspace, simply click the Mobileconnect lists link in the upper left corner
Click
and here is the daily deals mobile message list…it is now a list that we can send mobile messages to!
Filtered List
Click
to create a filtered list, we will click manage on the overview page
Click
Then we’ll select the Lists tab to be taken to the lists workspace
Click the Create List button
Next, we’ll select Create list in the upper right corner
Click
we’ll make sure the Filtered List radio button is selected in the create list dialog box…and it is,
Click the text box
We need to choose a starting population – or source list for our filt4ered list.
We will choose all m obile contacts, but we could choose any other lists that have been created in the account as the source if we wanted to
Click
On the left side of the screen we see all of the tables of attributes that are available for use to use when creating a filtered list.
Notice that we could use the exacttarget system data extension, the email data, mobileconnect data to name a few.
It’s here the power of contact builder is present.
Click the text box
If we wanted to use data that is stored in data extensions within the email application, and is viewable in Contact Builder to create our filtered list…we could.
So it’s true…through contact builder we have the ability to use cross channel data when creating a filtered list
In fact, here are all of the attributes available to us when creating this specific filtered list…these attributes are from the email application!
So we could drag gender, language, DOB, Address 1, city, state and zip over to the canvas to be used in our filtereing rules if we wanted.
That isn’t our use case today, but it’s important for you to know that you have that capability!
Click the text box
Our use case requires us to use the region attribute data that has been created in contact builder.  we want to create a filtered list that includes all contacts who live in the north region.
And because we imported a list of new contacts to a list in mobileconnect, that attribute data in contact builder now contains data on our contacts.
Remember, mobileconnect is the gateway for contact data to get to contact builder?
so we’ll access the mobileconnect demographics data extionsion by clicking here
Click and drag
Here is the region attribute – we’ll simply click and drag it to the canvas.
So the attribute that we want to use for the filtered list is identified
Click
and now the the rule appears – the region attributes appears to the left, the operator is in the middle
Click
when we click on the arrow the available operators appear.  for this scenario, equal is the correct operator
Click the Save & Build button
in the value box on the right, we’ll add the value we are looking for – in this case the region value is north
so the rules states:
If the region is equal to North, then add the contact to this filtered list
now it’s true this is a very simple scenario – you can see that with all of the different attributes available to you on the left of the screen- you could create very complex rules to ensure you are targeting your contacts the way you want.  you have a lot of flexibility!
TO move on…we’ll click the save and build button
Click the Save button
The list name is North Region List and The format will be standard – and we’ll click save to move on
Click
There are two records that fit the criteria – we could click on the contacts tab if we wanted to look at the individual records
Click
Maybe we aren’t happy with the number of contacts who meet the criteria…if that’s the case, we have the ability to change our criteria or rules to arrive at the number we are looking for – to do that, we would simply click the edit button to be taken back to the rules canvas
Click
and finally, we can see that our North Region List has been created and is ready to be sent mobile messages.
Now remember, we created a simply filter rule – you can be as complex as you want!
The sky is the limit!

Welcome to the Mobile Connect 101 data lesson.
In this lesson, we will take a close look at how data is managed when using Mobile Connect.
Before we get started, it's important for you to know that there is a course that explains the data model that is used with Mobile Connect called Contact Builder.
If you are a new or existing Mobile Connect user, it's important that you take the Contact Builder course to learn about this method of storing data.
You will find the course in the full course catalog on the same website you found this course.
Here's what you will learn in this data lesson, how data works with Mobile Connect, the definition of contacts and where they live,
what an attribute is and how to create, edit, and use them, what a list is and how to filter one.
Let's get started.
Data is very important when using Mobile Connect.
It can be used to filter lists, identify message recipients,
be used to populate messages that are relevant to the person receiving them, and much, much more.
There are three components to Mobile Connect data: contacts, attributes, and lists.
Let's begin by taking a closer look at Contacts.
Your data is composed of contacts.
In other words, a contact is a person who is either opted in to receive mobile communications from you,
or a contact is a person who has interacted with your company via a mobile product.
Simply put, it's a mobile phone number that you are sending a message to
or a mobile phone number that you've received a message from.
In the application you will be able to import data that consists of contacts and their personal profile information.
This data will be used in mobile message campaigns to send timely and relevant communications.
You might ask, where do contacts live?
All contacts live in Contact Builder for the mobile applications.
Again, if you haven't taken the Contact Builder course you should.
Mobile Connect contacts live in the Mobile Connect system-defined data extensions that are pictured here:
the Mobile Connect demographics, and the mobile subscriptions data extensions.
When your account is provisioned with Mobile Connect these system-defined data extensions are added to your account.{}You don't have to do any of the work.
These contain system information that is necessary for you to successfully send mobile messages.
These fields are called attributes.
Attributes are a very important part of Mobile Connect.
Let's take a closer look.
An attribute is data about the contact.
Mobile phone number is a required attribute in the Mobile Connect application,
so each contact cannot exist in the application without a mobile phone number attribute value.
Since mobile phone number is required, it makes sense that mobile number is the default unique identifier within the Mobile Connect application.
A unique identifier is the item that identifies a contact in the system.
Each unique ID can only exist one time and all data about an individual contact is stored on that unique identifier.{}Data like profile attributes, tracking results, message history, and more.
There are two types of attributes in Mobile Connect: system-defined attributes and custom attributes.
A system-defined attribute is data about a contact that is either required or provided automatically by Mobile Connect.
As a reminder, these attributes live on the two-system generated Mobile Connect data extensions that live in Contact Builder.
Custom attributes are those attributes that you create based on a specific need you may have.
Maybe you want to collect and utilize contact title, region, city, or favorite outdoor sport in your mobile campaigns.
It's totally up to you.
You can build any attributes you may need.
Just remember that they are built and managed in Contact Builder.
It's important to note that there are required attributes when using Mobile Connect.
This means that they must be populated for each contact in the file that you're importing or the contact will not be imported to the system.
The required attributes are mobile number, the phone number of the mobile device, and locale.
The country code of the mobile number, for example, United States is US
and if you use a subscriber key functionality in the email application,
then a contact key is required for each contact in Mobile Connect.
Attributes can be used in two ways.
To personalize the content of the mobile message,{}you can insert personalization strings in a message so the content is specific to the contact.
Relevant communication should always be your goal when sending messages, whether email or mobile,{}and attributes help you make this happen.
You can also target a specific segment of contacts using segmentation.
Attributes can be used to filter a list, so that those who live in Florida receive a message with a coupon for sandals,{}and those who live in Alaska receive a message with a coupon for snowshoes.
Again, relevance is key to effective communications, and attributes help make this happen.
Here is our Northern Trail Outfitters scenario.
Northern Trail Outfitters wants to send relevant mobile communications to their customers.
They want to store region information for their customers so they can send region-specific mobile messages to them.
A region attribute will be created in Contact Builder for use within Mobile Connect.
The following simulation will walk you through how to create an attribute in Contact Builder.
Click the button to begin.
Lists are created and contacts are imported to lists within Mobile Connect.
A list is a collection of contacts that can be sent to in an outbound message campaign.
You can send to a list or suppress a list at the time of send,
so it's true, a list can be a sending list or a suppression list.
While the contact's data is stored in Contact Builder,
lists are created within the Mobile Connect application.
Also, you will import contacts and their data to the list from within Mobile Connect,
then by default, and behind the scenes, the imported contacts and their data will be added to the Mobile Connect system data extensions that live in Contact Builder.
A standard list is a list of contacts compiled as a result of one or many imports or contacts who have been manually added directly into Mobile Connect.
Again, remember contacts and their data are added in Mobile Connect,
but this information really lives in Contact Builder.
Think of Mobile Connect as the gateway for contact information to ultimately be stored in Contact Builder.
In fact, the best way to understand this concept is to see it in action.
Here is the Northern Trail Outfitters scenario.
Northern Trail Outfitters wants to send a daily deal text message to customers who've opted in to receive the daily messages.
They will import new data each day and send the daily messages to a standard list.
A text message with the daily deal will be sent each day at 9:00.
The following simulation will walk you through how to create a list and import contacts to the list in Mobile Connect.
Click the button to begin.
A filtered list is a subset of mobile contacts that live in Contact Builder.
The contacts can be filtered and added to a list,
using contact attributes that are stored In the Mobile Connect System Data Extensions and Contact Builder.
The most amazing thing is, that because of the attribute data is stored in Contact Builder,
data from other channels can also be used in filtering lists.
Data extensions that are created and managed in the email application are viewable within Contact Builder, for example.
Email attribute data can be used in conjunction with mobile attribute data to create a filtered list.
That is the power of the Contact Builder model.
Let's see the creation of a filtered list in action.
Here is the Northern Trail Outfitters scenario.
Northern Trail Outfitters wants to send mobile coupons to customers based on their region.
They will use a region mobile attribute data that is stored in Contact Builder to create a filtered list.
A text message with a coupon will be sent to customers who match the criteria and have been added to the filtered list.
The following simulation will walk you through how to create a filtered list.
Click the button to begin.
Congratulations.
You have completed the Mobile Connect 101 data lesson.
Now it's time for you to choose your lessons.
It would be a great idea to view each one, but you don't have to.
Simply close out of this lesson and choose the next one that you'd like to take.
Here we are in the Contact Builder application.
In the upper left corner you can see that we are in the data designer area of Contact Builder.
Notice the different attribute groups that are available, or those that have been created for this account.
There are email data, mobile push data, Mobile Connect attribute groups, and more.
Stored within each group are corresponding data tables, some system generated and some created by users of the account.
In order to create an attribute to be used with the Mobile Connect application,
we need to click on the Mobile Connect attribute group.
Next we'll click the View and Edit button that is found within the attribute group.
Here are the two system data tables that are created by default when your account is provisioned for Mobile Connect.
They are the Mobile Connect demographic table, which contains information like carrier ID, channel, contact ID, locale, and more,
and the Mobile Connect subscriptions table that contains keyword, mobile number, opt-in date, and more.
You can use these attributes if you would like.
Some of them are required in order to have Mobile Connect function properly but the great thing is you can add custom attributes to the demographics table
and use them to send relevant messages or to create filtered lists.
To create an attribute, we'll simply hover over the top of the Mobile Connect demographics data extension,
and when the editing tools appear, we need to click on the small pencil icon to be taken to the next step.
Once we're in the Mobile Connect demographics data extension, all we have to do is click Create Attribute in the upper right corner.
Here is the box where the actual attribute creation takes place.
First, we need to give our attribute a name, and we're creating the region attribute, so that will be added here.
Next, we need to identify the data type.
In other words, what kind of data will we be storing for the region attribute.
There are many options like number, date, Boolean, email address, and more.
For region, we will use the text data type.
The length value box refers to the number of characters of the data.
For us, twenty is fine.
We'll probably never have a value length that exceeds twenty for the region attribute.
We could make this attribute the primary key or the unique value of the data extension, add a default value if needed, assign a data source or make the attribute required if we wanted.
For now we'll just leave these values as is and click Create.
Here it is.
The region attribute can now be used in our Mobile Connect campaigns.
That's how you create an attribute in Contact Builder for use within Mobile Connect.
To begin the list creation process we'll simply click on the arrow next to Manage and then choose Contacts.
This is the contacts workspace.
At the top, there is an All Contacts tab and a List tab.
By default, the All Contacts page is displayed and information about our contacts is shown.
We can see contact key, mobile number, email address if we know it, source, modified date, and more.
To continue creating a list, we need to click on the List tab.
Here is the List workspace.
Once we create our list, it will be seen here in the workspace, with information such as list name, contact count, list type, created, modified, status, and more.
To move forward in the list creation process, we'll select Create List.
In this Create List dialogue box we need to specify the method by which the list will be built.
Since we're going to upload a list from a computer desktop, we'll select the Create From File radio button, and then click OK to move on.
The progress bar at the top identifies that there are four steps in the import process.
Step one is where a file is uploaded.
Step two, a short code and keyword are selected.
In step three, the mapping is configured.
In step four, this is where the process is reviewed and saved.
We're in step one of the process.
It's here that the file to upload is selected.
By clicking Browse, we will be taken to the desktop where we can choose the appropriate file to upload.
In our case, we will upload the NTO contacts.csv file.
And here it is.
The NTO contacts file.
We'll select the file by clicking on it.
Next, we'll click the I Agree checkbox to ensure that the application knows that the individuals on the list have given us permission to send them mobile messages.
Here, we can see that the file upload is complete.
Now we've moved on to step two of the process.
We need to choose a short code and keyword that we want to associate with the new contacts.
We'll choose a short code 59545, and keyword NTO daily.
In step 3 the mapping is configured.
In other words, it's here that the column headers found on the spreadsheet will be mapped to the appropriate attributes that live on the Mobile Connect data extensions housed within Contact Builder.
There are 3 options, map by header row, by ordinal, or manually.
Because the file we're importing has column headers that are similar to the attribute names in the system, we will choose to map manually.
On the left, we can see the headers that were found on the NTO contacts file we're importing.
On the right, we see the attributes that are available or that have been created in Contact Builder.
Using the drop-down arrows, we can map the appropriate spreadsheet headers to attributes within Contact Builder.
Now, we can see that all the columns on the spreadsheet are mapped appropriately to the attributes in the system.
Mobile number to mobile number.
Locale is mapped to locale.
Contact key to contact key.
Even the region column is mapped to the custom attribute we created, region.
Now, step three is complete.
In step 4, we will review the import information and then choose Save and Build to move on.
In the Save As dialogue box we'll give our list a name.
The name for this list is Daily Deals Mobile Message.
Then we'll make sure the correct list format is selected.
In this case the Standard Format radio button is what we'll choose, and then we'll click Save to move on.
Here is the list information or list properties for the list we've just created.
We can see that there are 5 rows of data, and we can look at the individual contacts by clicking on the Contacts tab.
Here are the records.
We can see the data that we have on the contacts, like mobile number, source, modified date and channel,
and to view the list workspace, we simply click the Mobile Connect list link in the upper left corner.
And here is the daily deals mobile message list.
It is now a list that we can send mobile messages to, and that's how you create a list within Mobile Connect.
To create a filtered list, we will click Manage on the overview page.
Then we'll select the List tab to be taken to the list workspace.
Next, we'll select Create List in the upper right corner.
Since we're creating a filtered list, we need to make sure that the Filtered List radio button is selected in the Create List dialog box.
Here we need to choose a starting population, or a source list, for our filtered list.
We will choose All Mobile Contacts, but we could choose any other list that has been created in the account as a source, if we wanted to.
On the left side of the screen we see all of tables of attributes that are available for us to use when creating a filtered list.
Notice that we could use the exact target system data extension, the email data extension, Mobile Connect data extensions, to name a few.
It's here the power of Contact Builder is present.
If we wanted to use data that is stored in data extensions within the email application and is viewable in Contact Builder to create our filtered list we could.
So, it's true, through Contact Builder we have the ability to use cross-channel data when creating a filtered list.
In fact, here are all the attributes available to us when creating this specific filtered list.
These attributes are from the email application.
So, we could drag gender, language, date of birth, address 1, city, state, and zip over to the canvas to be used in our filtering rules if we wanted.
That's not our use case today but it is important for you to know that you do have that capability.
Our use case requires us to use region attribute data that has been created in Contact Builder.
We want to create a filtered list that includes all contacts who live in the north region.
Because we imported a list of new contacts to a list in Mobile Connect, that attribute data in Contact Builder now contains data on our contacts.
Remember, Mobile Connect is a gateway for contact data to get to Contact Builder, so we'll access the Mobile Connect demographics data extension by clicking here.
Here is the region attribute.
We'll simply click and drag it to the canvas, so the attribute that we want to use for the filtered list is identified.
And now the rule appears.
The region attribute appears to the left, the operator is in the middle.
When we click on the arrow, the available operators appear.
For this scenario, equal is the correct operator.
In the value box on the right, we'll add the value we're looking for.
In this case, the region value is north.
The rule states, "If the region is equal to north, then add the contact to this filtered list."
Now it's true that this is a very simple scenario.
You can see that all of the different attributes available to you on the left of the screen could really be used to create very complex rules.{}Just to make sure that you're targeting your contacts the way you want, you really do have a lot of flexibility.
To move on, we'll click the Save and Build button.
The list name is north region list and the format will be standard.
Then we'll click Save to move on.
There are two records that fit the criteria.
We could click on the Contacts tab if we wanted to look at the individual records.
Maybe we aren't happy with the number of contacts who meet the criteria.
If that's the case, we have the ability to change our criteria or rules to arrive at the number we're looking for.
To do that we would simply click the Edit button to be taken back to the rules canvas.
Finally we can see that our north region list has been created and is ready to be sent mobile messages.

Customer Service
Maybe your goal is to send messages that are dynamic or unique in nature.
Here is a good example of dynamic messages using text response.
In this case, NTO would like to help their customers quickly and easily find the holiday hours of the store  location nearest them.
Customers are encouraged to text in the Keyword Holiday and their zip code to 12345.  t
The corresponding text response message has AMPScript in the body of the message – the Marketing Cloud’s scripting language
When a response is sent to a customer, the ampscript activates and looks at the databasee that contains the zip code information.
The appropriate store location and holiday hours are then added to the text response message.

So here’s how it works,
The user creates keywords in mobileconnect and designs a campaign or CTA to display their message
Customers see the CTA message and receive a response sms message by texting the keyword to the short code.
In this case, customers will text ntocoupons to receive a coupon to be used at an NTO store
{}Three Step Process{}

{}Schedule and Activate{}
Three Step Process
There are 3 steps to creating a Text Response campaign in the MobileConnect application
In one, you choose the appropriate template, in this case, the text response template
Next, the content is defined.
In other words, you identify the keyword and short code used to power the message, as well as create the actual message itself.
Finally, the message is scheduled and activited so it is a live campaign.
That’s it.

View Scene
Click
We’ll simply click create message in the upper right corner to create the text response campaign
Click
Here is step 1 – where we choose a template –
Now you’ll notice that only 7 templates appear here, not all 10.
This may be the case for you as well, if you would like to have access to the other 3 templates, simply talk to your account representative.
All 10 templates do not appear by default.
we need to select the text response template
Click and drag
We’ve complete step 1
now for step 2, which is where we define the content
First, the message needs to be given a name, and in this case, In-Store 10% off coupon code is the message name
Next, we need to select the appropriate short or long code
It is possible that your mobileconnect account has more than one code provisioned.
Simply click on the arrow to show all available short or long codes
We only have one short code available, so we’ll choose it – short code 59545
Next, we need to choose the appropriate keyword to power this campaign.
It’s nice to know that you have the ability to create a new keyword right as you are building a campaign.
Simply choose the create keyword radio button and type in the desired keyword and click create.
If the keyword is already in use, you will be told it isn’t available, and you can try a different keyword.
For this message,NTOCOUPON is the keyword that will drive this campaign
If we wanted to continue the conversation without requiring the mobile device user to keep on texting in keywords, we could use the next keyword functionality.
That’s not our scenario today, so we will move to the call to action section of the of this page.
This area is totally optional.
It is only for users of the application and helps describe the corresponding call to action that will prompt individuals to text the keyword to the short code.
In our case, we are going to type the text of the print materials found in our NTO stores
Click and drag
Our signs read – for 10%off today’s purchase, text ntocoupon to 59545, so we’ve added that information here
Under the messages header we find the Response MEssage box.
It’s here we will type the message that will be sent
in the message box, we have the ability to insert content – like stored headers, footers, or personalization strings that will insert attributes values into the message
we can also shorten a URL if we are adding one to our message because the characters in a url will count toward our total message character count with 160 characters being the maximum
We can also abbreviate common words to use fewer characters too
you’ll see the number of characters used in the lower left corner
and…a preview of the message as you type it can be seen to the right
Click
Let’s just add a simple static coupon code message to this campaign
we’ll add ”Use the code NTO10PERCENT for 10% off your purchase today to the message boxOnce it’s complete, and if we like the way it looks in the preview pane, we simply click ok to move on
Click the text box
Here is the default error message…it states ”Sorry there was an error.
Please try again.”
We can keep the default error message or change it if we want.
We’ll just keep the default message
If we want to associate this message to a campaign that we are managing in the Marketing Cloud we can do that…or we can even create a new campaign here as well
And we can perform a test by clickin on the Perform test button – just to make sure that we’ve set everything up correctly in this template
When we’re ready, we’ll click next in the upper right corner
Click
Here is the third and final step
At the top there is a summary section which provides summary information about the message
Like message name, template used, short code and keyword
There is also an Activiation area which is where the message can be activated immedately, or it can be scheduled for the future
Let’s click the future/recurring button
Click
a calendar appears that allows us to identify the start and end date of the send as well time zone of the send
Click the Schedule button
when we’re ready, we’ll simply click schedule to activate the message
Click the Confirm button
and then confirm to complete the process
Click
and finally, we can see that this message is now live and ready to go!
The NTOCOUPON text response campaign is set up and running!
And that’s how you create a text response campaign in mobileconnect

Welcome to the Mobile Connect 101 text response lesson.

They share valuable information that will help you during this text response lesson.
Here is what you will learn: the definition of a text response message, typical use cases for a text response campaign will be shared, and you'll also learn how to create a text response message.
Let's get started.
A text response template allows you to create an automatic response to an inbound SMS message.
Text response campaigns are a perfect way for you to bring offline customers online.
They encourage them to text a keyword to a short code via a call to action that is typically offline like signage in a store, on a billboard, or an ad on the radio.
You can respond with a message that includes a coupon, QR code, or up-to-the-minute information and much, much more.
Here is a great use case, coupons via text response.
The call to action is seen on the left.
This might be an in-store promotion, for example.
While shopping, customers are encouraged to text NTO to 12345 to get 10% off of any purchase they're going to make today.
The response message they receive includes the 10% off coupon code.
This is another great example of the way you can use text response.
NTO wants to customers who are interested in getting information about their returns and exchange policies quickly and easily.
With signage around the store, customers can text Returns to 12345 and in real time they receive a text message with NTO's return and exchange policies.
Maybe your goal is to send messages that are dynamic or unique in nature.
Here is a good example of dynamic messages using text response.
In this case, NTO would like to help their customers quickly and easily find the holiday hours of the store location nearest them.
Customers are encouraged to text in the keyword "Holiday" and their ZIP code to 12345.
The corresponding text response message has amp script in the body of the message; the marketing cloud scripting language.
When a response is sent to a customer, the amp script activates and looks at the database that contains the ZIP code information.
The appropriate store location and holiday hours are then added to the text response message.
Here's how it works.
The user creates keywords in Mobile Connect and designs a campaign or CTA to display their message.
Customers see the CTA message and receive a response SMS message by texting the keyword to the short code.
In this case, customers will text “NTO coupons” to receive a coupon to be used at an NTO store.
There are three steps to creating a text response campaign in the Mobile Connect application.
In step one, you choose the appropriate template, in this case, the text response template.
Next, the content is defined.
In other words, you identify the keyword and short code used to power the message, as well as create the actual message itself.
Finally, the message is scheduled and activated, so it is a live campaign.
That's it.
Here is the NTO text response scenario.
Northern Trail Outfitters wants to offer mobile coupons to customers as they shop in brick and mortar stores.
They want to use various print CTAs throughout the store.
Employees will also be trained to encourage customers to text in the key word to the short code to receive the coupon.
A text message with the coupon code will be sent to customers.
The following simulation will walk you through the steps necessary to create a text response message.
Click the button to begin.
Congratulations.
You have completed the Mobile Connect 101 text response lesson.

If the keyword is already in use, you will be told it's not available, and you should then try a different keyword.
For this message, "NTO coupon" is the keyword that will drive this campaign.

Now here is the default error message.
It states, "Sorry there was an error.

We can keep the default error message or change it if we want.
We'll just keep this message.
If we want to associate this message to a campaign that we're managing in the marketing cloud, we can do that, or we can even create a new campaign here as well.
We can perform a test by clicking on the Perform Test button just to make sure that we've set everything up correctly in this template.
When we're ready, we'll click Next in the upper right corner.
Here is the third and final step.
At the top, there is a summary section, which provides summary information about the message, like message name, template used, short code and keyword.
There is also an activation area, which is where the message can be activated immediately or it can be scheduled for the future.
Let's click the Future Recurring button.
A calendar appears that allows us to identify the start and end date of the send, as well as the time zone of the send.
When we're ready we'll simply click Schedule to activate the message.
Then confirm to complete the process.
Finally, we can see that this message is now live and ready to go.
The NTO coupon text response campaign is set up and running.
That's how you create a text response campaign in Mobile Connect.

Email Opt-in Use Case
Email Opt-in Use Case
Here is a great example of how email opt in can be used
NTO has instore signage that encourages their customers to text NTO a space and their email address to 12345 to be added to an email list.
The emails that follow might contain coupons, special information that is only sent to email subscribers, info about special events at brick and mortar stores and more!
Receives the text and sends confirmation SMS and email
Contact texts in keyword and email address to short code
Text {}Signmeup {}and your email address to
{}88769{}
To receive our Monthly Newsletter!
Text {}Signmeup {}and your email address to
To receive our Monthly Newsletter!
Untitled Slide
So here’s how an email opt in template works!
The user creates the cta giving the customer the information they need to be added to an email list – in this case we see a sign that says text signmeup and your email address to 88769 to receive our monthly newsletter
the contact texts in the keyword and the email address to the short code
once the mobilcconnect application receives the text, a confirmation sms message will be sent to the mobile device user letting them know that they’ve been added to the list and that an email will follow shortly!
Finally, when it’s time, the monthly newsletter will be sent to them!
{}Four Step Process{}
{}v{}
{}Select the Email Opt-In Template{}
{}Define Content{}
{}Select Audience{}
{}Schedule and Activate{}
Four Step Process
There are 4 steps to creating an email opt-in  campaign in the MobileConnect application
In step one, you choose the appropriate template, in this case, the email opt in template
Next, the content is defined.
In other words, you identify the keyword and short code used to power the message, as well as create the actual message itself.
the third step is necessary if the call to action originates from an outbound sms message.
If the call to action is a sign in a store, for example, then step 3 is not necessary and is skipped.
<rpr id="57">Finally, the message is scheduled and activited so it is a live campaign.

Congratulations
Congratulations, you have completed the mobileconnect 101 email opt in lesson!
Go ahead and close this lesson and then choose the next lesson you would like to take
View Scene
Click
Once we’ve accessed  the mobileconnect application, We’ll simply click create message in the upper right corner to begin the creation the email opt-in  campaign
Click
Here is step 1 – where we will choose a template for this campaign
Now you’ll notice that only 7 templates appear here, not all 10.
All 10 templates do not appear by default.
we need to select the email opt-in  template
Type Monthly Newsletter List
Now we’re onto step two of the process and this message will be named monthly newsletter list so we’ll add that here
Click
Next, we need to select the appropriate short or long code – We only have one short code available, so we’ll choose it – short code 59545
Click
Next, we need to choose the appropriate keyword to power this campaign.
You can create a new keyword or choose an existing one – the dropdown displays the available keywords, we’ll choose NTONEWS
Click
If we wanted to continue the conversation without requiring the mobile device user to keep on texting in keywords, we could use the next keyword functionality.
That’s not our scenario today, so we will move to the call to action section of the of this page.
This is where we identify what type of call to action will be associated with this email opt-in campaign.
If we chose the Outbound option, then there would be 4 steps to creating the email opt-in campain.
That’s because we would need to create the outbound sms message,  as well as the list we would send the message to.
The message sent would include the CTA or action we want the mobile device user to take…to add themselves to our monthly newsletter list.
But since our CTA is an external source, signs in our store, we will choose that option and the number of steps changes to 3.
In our case, we are going to Select the external source as the call to action and we’ll add the CTA info to the value box
Scroll the mouse wheel
Our CTA message is:
Text NTONEWS and your email address to short code 59545 to be added to our monthly newsletter list.
In the Messages header and Response message area  we see that we could insert content or personalization if we wanted, shorten a URL if there is one in the message, or abbreviate the text.
Remember, the maximum character count for a text message is 160 characters  You’ll see the number of characters used in the lower left corner
and a  preview of the message as you type it can be seen to the right
You can see we’ve  added a simple static message to this campaign  It says: thanks for your interest!
You’ve been added to the monthly newsletter list.
An email will follow shortly
The default error message can be changed if needed, but we’ll just keep it as is because it communicates information that we want to be sent if there is an error
Now we’ll scroll down to complete further information
Click
We need to identify which list in the email application the individuals who opt-in with this keyword should be added to.
You see that we can create a list on the fly as we create this message, or we can select a list that is already built in the email application.
That’s our use case today, we’ll click on select a list.
It’s important to point out that the individuals will be added to a list in the email application - so…this is where you are seeing cross channel functionality in play – we’re using the mobile channel to add subscribers to an email list!
Click
So here are the available lists found in the my lists folder in the email application.
we’ll add the new contacts to the the monthly newsletter list
Click the Next button
we could add a campaing association or create a new campaign if we wanted, but instead we’ll choose Next to continue
Click
At the top there is a summary section which provides summary information about the message
There is also an Activiation area which is where the message can be activated immedately, or it can be scheduled for the future
Let’s choose immediately
Click the Schedule button
and then click schedule in the upper right corner
Click
and  confirm to complete the process
Click
and finally, we can see that this message is now live and ready to go!
The NTONEWS Email Opt-In campaign is set up and running!
And that’s how you create an email opt-in campaign in mobileconnect

Now we see that this message is now live and ready to go, the NTO News email opt-in campaign is set up and running and that's how you create an email opt-in campaign in Mobile Connect.
Welcome to the Mobile Connect 101 email opt-in lesson.
Hopefully, you've taken the overview and data lessons.
If not, you should.
They share valuable information that will help you during this email opt-in lesson.
Here is what you will learn: the definition of an email opt-in message,
typical use cases for an email opt-in campaign will be shared, and you'll also learn how to create an email opt-in message.
Let's get started.
The email opt-in template allows you to invite people to subscribe to your email messages via SMS.
An email opt-in campaign is used to bring offline customers online by encouraging an individual to text the keyword and their email address to a short code to sign up for emails such as newsletters, coupons, et cetera.
It's a perfect way for you to set up a simple campaign that once activated, will be a quick and easy way for your customers to opt in to receive your email communications.
It's easy for you to set it and forget it.
You create the campaign and then you sit back and watch your email list grow.
Here is a great example of how email opt-in can be used.
NTO has in-store signage that encourages their customers to text NTO, a space and their email address to 12345 to be added to an email list.
The emails that might follow could contain coupons, special information that is only sent to email subscribers, information about special events at brick and mortar stores and much, much more.
So, here's how an email opt-in template works.
The user creates the CTA giving the customer the information they need to be added to an email list.
In this case, we see a sign that says Text “sign me up and your email address to 88769 to receive our monthly newsletter”.
The contact texts in the keyword and their email address to the short code.
Once the Mobile Connect application receives the text a confirmation SMS message will be sent to the mobile device user letting them know that they've been added to the list and then an email will follow shortly.
Finally, when it's time, the monthly newsletter will be sent to them.
There are four steps to creating an email opt-in campaign in the Mobile Connect application{}.{}
In step one, you choose the appropriate template, in this case, the email opt-in template.
Next the content is defined.
In other words, you identify the key word and short code used to power the message as well as create the actual message itself.

Welcome Message
This is a great example of a way to use the Outbound message template.
A new contact has opted-in to receive sms message from NTO.
The outbound message reads:
Welcome to Northern Trail Outfitters alerts!
Stay tuned here for special sms only discounts and rewards.
Reply help for help reply stop to cancel.
It is a good idea to send a welcome message that confirms that the opt-in has taken place.
That they know they will be receiving messages from you.
Why not add message frequency information, the types of messages they will receive, as well as give them the opportunity to get help or to stop receiving messages.

Our Use Case
So here is how the outbound message works.
The mobileconnect user  has CTAs online and offline requesting their customers to opt-in to receive outbound messages, in his case daily deals.
The mobile device user texts in the appropriate keyword, to opt-in to receive the daily outbound sms message.
A message is created in MobileConnect,  and is scheduled to be sent each day to those who have opted-in.
Data is updated each day so that the message goes to the most-up-to date list of opted-in contacts.
{}Six Step Process{}
{}v{}
{}Create an Attribute{}
{}Create a Keyword{}
{}Create a List{}
{}Import to a List{}
{}Create Outbound Message{}
{}Send Outbound Message{}
Prepare Your File
There are six steps necessary to creating an outbound message.
Step one – create an attribute.
You learned how to create an attribute in the data lesson in this course.
If you want to personalize the messages you are going to send to contacts, you need to first create an attribute.
Next, Create a Keyword,  Administrators can create keywords for you, this is covered in the administration lesson.
Or you can create a keyword during the outbound message creation process.
Step 3 and 4 create a list and import to a list – you learned how to do this during the data lesson.
It makes sense that you would need a list to send an outbound message to..right?
Once those 4 steps are complete, it’s time to move onto step 5, which is when you will create the outbound message
and finally in step 6, you send the message
we’ll complete steps 5 and 6 in this lesson

We’ll simply click create message in the upper right corner to create the outbound message
Click
Here is step 1 – we need to select the outbound template
Click
Now we’re onto step two of the process and the message name is Daily Deal Message
Next, we need to select the appropriate short or long code – We only have one short code available, so we’ll choose it – short code 59545
and we’ll skip the Next Keyword
Under the Messages heading, we identify the send method.
Will it be scheduled – meaning the message will be sent immediately or at the date and time we determine in the last step of the message creation process
API triggered – the message will be sent via an api call
Automation – the message will be created in such a way that it can be Automated using Automation Studio – that’s our use case today – this is the perfect example of an outbound message that we would want to automate – it goes out everyday at the same time, why not place it in an automate it?
or it could be sent as an interaction for use with Journey Builder
we’ll choose the automation send method
Click the text box
The message will start with:
Today’s Daily Deals
We want to add a dynamic element to our message – the deals change daily.
Each day we do an import of new opt-in contacts, and new daily deal product and price data as well.
The data is stored as attributes in Contact Builder.
We only want to create this message once, so we can add personalization strings to the message so at the time of send, the appropriate and most up-to-date product and price info is added to the message.
In other words, each day the daily deal changes, and we have to import the data before the message is sent.
This way, the correct message is sent!
To add the attribute values, we will click on insert content
Click
first, we want to add the personalization string for Daily Deal Product, so we’ll choose that attribute and we can see that the personalization string %%Daily Deal Product%%  is automatically added to the message.
At the time of send, the correct value will be added to the message, exactly where the personalization string is!
Click
The same steps were taken to add the price of the product to the message as well.
Also, you can see that we added a link to the product, so the contact can easily access the site to purchase the daily deal.
Notice that the preview is not showing a preview of the message.
that’s because mobilcconnect cannot generate a preview of a message when the message has personalization strings or ampscript
if you want to preview the message before you send it, use the test message field to send an example o fyour message to a test contact.
Click and drag
Because this is an outbound message, we need to identifiy a list or lists of contacts to send to
any available list will be listed here in the lists workspace
simply drag any lists you want to receive the message to the target lists box
and if you want to exclude a list from the send, be sure to drag it to the exclusion lists box
we’ll drag the Daily Deals Mobile Message to the target lists box and then next to continue
Click the Activate button
Here is the summary that we’ve seen while building other campaigns
to activate the send, we’ll click activate
Click the Confirm button
and then confirm
Click the cell
and finally, we can see that this message is now live and ready to go!
The daily deals outbound message campaign is set up and running!
And that’s how you create a outbound message campaign in mobileconnect

2.11 Congratulations
Welcome to the Mobile Connect 101 Outbound Message lesson.
Here is what you will learn in this lesson: the definition of outbound messages, typical use cases for outbound messages and how to create them.
Let's get started.
What is an outbound message?
The outbound message template allows you to send an SMS message from Mobile Connect to mobile phone users that opt in to receive SMS messages from you.
Outbound messages can be used to alert, inform and engage mobile users.
This is a great example of a way to use the outbound message template.
A new contact has opted in to receive SMS messages from NTO.
They receive a message that states, "Welcome to Northern Trailer Outfitters alerts.
Stay tuned to hear for special SMS only discounts and rewards.
Reply help for help.
Reply stop to cancel."
This is just a welcome message because they will still continue to receive outbound messages, but it's not a bad idea to include information like message frequency, types of messages, et cetera in that initial outbound message.
Or what about this use case, a social promotion via outbound.
The message NTO sends to opted-in contacts reads “NTO is running a Facebook contest starting this month, discover how you can win at www.Facebook.com/NTO.”
So, when the recipient clicks on the link they're going to be taken to the NTO Facebook page where they can sign up for the sweepstakes.
Who knows, they might even decide to add themselves to email lists that are listed on the form.
Now, NTO has really gone cross channel, mobile outbound message to a social Facebook page, and even an email opt-in value box on the sign up form.
You have a lot of flexibility when using outbound messages.
Here is how the outbound message works.
The Mobile Connect user has CTAs online and offline requesting their customers opt-in to receive outbound messages.{}In this case, Daily Deals.
The mobile device user texts in the appropriate keyword to opt-in to receive the daily outbound SMS message.
A message is created in Mobile Connect and is scheduled to be sent each day to those who have opted in.
Data is updated each day so that the message goes to the most up-to-date list of opted-in contacts.
There are six steps necessary to creating an outbound message.
Step one, create an attribute.
You learned how to create an attribute in the data lesson in this course.
If you want to personalize messages you're going to be sending to contacts, you need to first create an attribute.
Next, create a keyword.
Administrators can create keywords for you.
This is covered in the administration lesson, or you can create a keyword during the outbound message creation process.
Steps three and four, create a list and import to a list.
You learned how to do this during the data lesson.
It makes sense that you would need a list to send an outbound message to, right?
Once those four steps are complete, it's time to move on to step five, which is when you will create the outbound message.
Finally, in step six, you send the message.
We'll complete steps five and six in this lesson.
Here is the Northern Trail Outfitters' outbound message scenario.
Northern Trail Outfitters wants to send a daily deal text message to customers who have opted in to receive the messages.
They will use an outbound message campaign to send messages each day.
A text message with the product information, price and link to the daily deal on their website will be sent each morning at 9 AM.
The following video will walk you through the process of creating an outbound message using Mobile Connect.
Congratulations.
You have completed the Mobile Connect 101 outbound message lesson.
Go ahead and close this lesson, and choose the next one you'd like to take.
We'll simply click Create Message in the upper right corner to create the outbound message.
Here is step one. We need to select the outbound template.
Now we've moved on to step two of the process and you can see the message is named Daily Deal Message.
Next, we need to select the appropriate short or long code.
We'll choose short code 59545 and we'll skip the Next keyword.
Under the messages heading, we need to identify the send method.
Will it be scheduled, meaning the message will be sent immediately or at the date and time we determined in the last step of the message creation process,
API triggered, the message will be sent via an API call, automation, the message will be created in such a way that it can be automated using Automation Studio and that's our use case today.
This is the perfect example of an outbound message that we would want to automate.
It goes out everyday at the same time, why not place it in an automation?
Or, it can be sent as an interaction for use with Journey Builder.
We'll choose the automation send method.
You can see that our message starts with “today's daily deals.”
Now we want to add a dynamic element to our message.{}The deals change daily.
Each day, we do an import of new opt-in contacts and a new daily deal product and price data as well.
The data is stored as attributes in Contact Builder.
We only want to create this message once, so we can add personalization strings to the message so that at the time of send,{}the appropriate and most up-to-date product and price information is added to the message.
In other words, each day the daily deal changes and we have to import the data before the message is sent.
This way, the correct message is sent.
To add the attribute values, we will click on Insert Content.
First, we want to add the personalization string for the daily deal product.
We'll choose that attribute and we can see that the personalization string %%dailydealproduct%% is automatically added to the message.
At the time of send, the correct value will be added to the message, exactly where the personalization string is.
The same steps were taken to add the price of the product to the message as well.
Notice that the preview is not showing a preview of the message.
That's because Mobile Connect cannot generate a preview of a message, when the message has personalization strings or AMPscript.
If you want to preview the message before you send it, use the Test Message field to send an example of your message to a test contact.
Because this is an outbound message, we need to identify a list or lists of contacts to send to.
Any available list will be seen here in the Workspace.
Simply drag any of the lists that you'd like to receive a message to the Target List box, and if you want to exclude a list from this end, be sure to drag it to the Exclusion List box.
We'll drag the Daily Deals Mobile Message to the Target List box and then click Next to continue.
Here is the summary that we've seen while building other campaigns.
To activate this end we'll simply click Activate.
Finally, we'll click Confirm to complete the process.

{}Create Stored Content{}
Untitled Slide
There are many tasks that administrators of a mobile connect account do.
One of these tasks is to create stored content that can be used by users of the account to populate messages.
Let’s take a closer look
{}Stored Content{}
{}What is Stored Content?{}
Content that is created by an Administrator that allows users to re-use content over and over in messages sent via MobileConnect.
{}How is it used?{}
Stored Content can be Header or Footer information.
Not only do they begin and end the message, they ensure consistency.
Header examples are, Welcome to NTO Alerts! and Thanks for subscribing.
Footer examples are, Reply STOP to cancel, or Msg & Data rates may apply.

stored content can be header information that is inserted at the beginning of outgoing messages, or footer information that is added to the end of outgoing messages.
Not only do they begin and end the message, they also ensure consistency.
Header examples are:  welcome to NTO Alerts! and thanks for subscribing
footer examples might be reply stop to cancel or msg & data rates may apply
When creating a new message, you can choose which header and footer (s) to include.
Note on stored content:
A maximum of three headers and footers can be created.

{}Set a Blackout Time{}
Untitled Slide
Administrators are also responsible for identifying potential blackout times and making sure that the account has the appropriate time set.
Here is more information about blackout times
{}Blackout Time{}
{}What is a Blackout Time?{}
It is a period of time during which no messages will be sent.
{}How is it used?{}
A Blackout Time is used to prevent contacts from receiving messages at inopportune times.
By setting a Blackout Time, an Administrator is ensuring that messages will not be scheduled and sent during the identified time.

{}Create Keyword{}
Untitled Slide
Keywords are the action words in a mobile campaign.
The administrator can create keywords for users, or the users can create their own.
if an administrator creates a keyword for users, they will do it in a different part of the application than a user would.
Let’s learn more about where and how adminstrators can create keywords.
{}Keyword{}
{}What is a Keyword?{}
A keyword is a unique, identifying word that enables you to interact with your customers via SMS or MMS.
A keyword is used as the action word that kicks off a specific campaign within MobileConnect.
{}How is it used?{}
A consumer might text COUPON to a short code to receive a 20% off coupon, or SIGNMEUP to join an email list.

a typical way that a keyword mioght be used is as a call to action to encourage a  mobile device user text the keyword coupon to a short code to receive a 20% off couon, or the mobile device user might text signmep to join an email list.
some important things to note:

Click the text box
Click Administration to get to the administration workspace
Click the Add link
The stored content is found in the upper center of the page.
As an administrator, you can create stored headers, or stored footers
the creation process is the same, so we’ll create a stored header to be used with NTO Alerts in the future
Notice that you can only create 3 headers and 3 footers
Once a header or footer is created, it will be listed here and the counter will keep track of the amount of stored content you have available.
to begin the process, we are going to click add next to headers
Click
In the Headers dialog box, we’ll click Add New
Type Welcome To NTO Alerts!
We could insert content if we wanted, shorten a url, or abbreviate words, just like when we create a message.
THat’s not our use case, so we’re going to add welcome to NTO Alerts to the value box.
Click the Save button
and then Save
Click
And our stored header content is now listed here.
So, any user of the mobileconnect account can add this header to messages that they create.
THey simply would click o nthe insert content drop down to add it to a message.
You’ll see the number has now changed to 2 availble headers to create.  if we want to edit the or delete the created header, we would click the edit link.
the same steps would be taken in order to create footer content as well.

Click the text box
to create a blackout time, Click Administration to get to the administration workspace
Click the Set Blackout Window link
THe administrator can create a blackout window time by locating the send blackout area in the upper right corner of the adminstration workspace
To begin the process, we will click the set blackout window link
Click
Once the blackout window is enabled, we need to identify the timeframe for the blackout.
The start time is found on the left side – our window is from 11:30 pm to 8:30 am
we’ll select 11:30 pm as the start time
Click the 8:30 AM list item
and 8:30 as the end time
Click the Save button
and to complete the task, we’ll click save
Click
now we can see that the send blackout time for this account is from 11:30 pm to 8:30 am.
If we need to change the time, we can click edit and update it to the appropriate send blackout period.
And that’s how an administrator can set the send blackout time in MobileConnect

Click the text box
it’s very easy to create a keyword as an administrator.
To begin the process, simply click the administration link in the tool bar at the top
Click the text box
and once in the administration nworkspace, we need to select the short code for the keyword.
In this case, there is only one short code in this account, so we’ll click on the shortcode
Type NTO
To create a keyword, simply type in the name of the keyword in the Create Keyword value box.
We’ll add NTO to the box.
Because keywords need to be unique across a particular short code, we will be shown immediately if the keyword is available or not.
In this case, NTO is a keyword we can use.
The last step is to simply click create.
Click the cell
now we can see that the NTO keyword is available for campaigns.  and that is how an administrator will create a keyword in  the adminstration workspace.

To begin the process, we're going to click Add next to headers.
In the Headers dialog box, we'll click Add New.

To complete the process, we'll simply click Save.
Our stored header content is now listed here.
Any user of the Mobile Connect account can add this header to messages that they create.
They simply would click the Insert Content drop-down to add it to a message.
You will see the number has now changed to two available headers to create.

The last step is to simply click Create.
Now we can see that the NTO keyword is available for mobile campaigns.
That's how an administrator will create a keyword in the Administration workspace.

Resources & Tools
{}Speaker1:{}
Let’s first begin with understanding the resources and tools to help you implement salesforce.
{}Bookmark this URL:{}
{}www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted{}
Getting Started Quickstart
{}Speaker1:{}
New customers tell us they need help understanding where to start.
We’ve listened and consolidated the most critical resources into one central hub, called our Getting Started Quickstart page.
Bookmark the following webpage: www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted.
All the resources we’ll be discussing are accessible through this webpage.
Now, let’s dive in to the detail.
Getting Started Series
Live Webinars
On Demand Videos
http://www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted
{}Speaker1:{}
Customers also asked for guidance around implementing salesforce, so we created the Getting Started Series.
This four part series provides prescriptive steps for getting up and running with salesforce, taking you from preparation to deployment.
The content is divided into 4 main parts, including:
Prepare for success, where you’ll learn how to prioritize your business objectives
Create the user experience, which will provide you best practices on setting up salesforce to align with your business
Enable the User Experience with Data, which will focus on tips on how to prepare, import, and manage your data
and Deploy and Empower your end users, which will provide guidance on training, support, and motivation techniques to drive adoption
This series will arm you with the information you need to deploy salesforce.
Access the Getting started quickstart for links to register for live webinars and view on demand videos.
Set-Up Salesforce Series
http://www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted
{}Speaker1:{}
As you make your way through the series, another resource we want to highlight as part of our Create the User Experience step is the Setup Salesforce Series.
We created demonstration videos where saleforce experts guide you through completing baseline customization tasks, such as setting up users or leads.
After watching the demonstration, you can then access a step by step walkthrough which takes you directly in to your instance of salesforce to perform the task.
Let’s talk through an example:
A common task customers need to complete is creating a custom field.
To learn how to perform this task, begin with watching the Setup leads video.
Then, when you’re ready to customize, select the ‘add lead custom field’ walkthrough.
Get step by step guidance within your instance of Salesforce.
Walkthroughs
http://www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted
{}Speaker1:{}
The walkthrough goes directly to the lead setup area within your instance of salesforce.
It will take you step by step through the process of creating a new field within your lead object.
You’re not only viewing the steps, your completing them as you work your way through each step of the walkthrough.
By the end of the Setup Series, you will have completed the baseline steps for customizing salesforce.
Getting Started Workbook

Think of the workbook as your checklist to deploy salesforce.
Use it to <size val="1100"><kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">document your decisions, define how to tailor salesforce to your business, and find links to relevant resources.</font></fill-sd></kern></size>
The workbook will be a valuable reference document and a helpful tool to access as your business needs evolve.
Be sure to download the Getting Started Workbook from the quickstart page.
This will help you begin to understand the steps you will work through in the upcoming weeks.
Success – Getting Started Community
http://www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted
Get answers.
Stay connected.
{}Speaker1:{}
Customers also requested a place to ask questions and learn from others, which is why we created the Success – Getting Started group within our Success Community.
This forum was built to provide new customers a place to engage with salesforce experts and other customers like you.
Let me share two examples we saw last week within the Getting Started community;
- A new customer who has never implemented salesforce, posted a note to the community asking for their top 2 lessons learned during the implementation process.
He quickly received 10 posts from other customers and partners sharing their experiences.
- Another example is more specific.
A new customer had created custom fields on leads and needed to understand how to carry over these new fields to a converted opportunity.
She posted her question, and within an hour, she had answers from both a salesforce expert and a customer giving her a solution.
As a success resource here at salesforce, my goal is to make sure there is no question left behind in our community.
Later in the webinar, we’ll show you exactly how to join and take advantage of this valuable resource.
Meet the new user experience in Salesforce
Lightning Experience is a new, modern user experience in Salesforce
Lightning Experience
Salesforce Classic
{}Speaker1:{}
First, I want to take a moment to introduce our re-vamped user interface, called Lightning Experience.
Lightning was recently released in October 2015 and is primarily focused on providing sales users a more productive interface.
It is designed to enhance ease of navigation, data entry, and usability.
We are aware that some of you watching may still be using the previous user interface, now referred to as Salesforce Classic.
Some features are not yet supported in the Lightning experience, but are still available in Salesforce Classic.
Now, you might be asking yourself, “am I on the new Lightning Experience or Salesforce Classic”?
The best way to determine what you are using today is to view your home screen.
Lightning Experience
{}Speaker1:{}
(1) When you first log in to salesforce, do you see a vertical navy bar displaying icons running down the left side of the screen?
If yes, you are on the Lightning experience.
Classic Experience
{}Speaker1:{}
(2) If you log on and instead see a horizontal row of tabs across the top of your screen, then you are on Salesforce Classic.
General navigation is different in Lightning versus Classic.
If you are currently using the new Lightning experience, keep watching.
Getting Started Series
On Demand Videos
<lnk-c val="&lt;a:hlinkClick r:id=&quot;rId3&quot;/&gt;">{}www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted</lnk-c>{}
{}Speaker1:{}
The demos we perform in this webinar will be shown on the UI selected by the audience majority from our next poll.
We’ll be covering tips and terminology that applies to everyone regardless of whether you are using Lightning or Classic.
All of our webinars are available as a recordings.
We’ll be sending you an email with direct links to our on demand videos, or you can find our video link within the Getting Started Quickstart page.
We’ve included video demonstrations in both the classic and lightning experience, so be sure to watch the one that’s most relevant to you.
Learn how to navigate Salesforce
{}Speaker1:{}
Now, let’s take the time to go through how to navigate Salesforce with the new Lightning Experience user interface.
We’ll share some Salesforce terms to help you become familiar with key areas of the application.
We will cover the home page, the navigation bar, and app launcher.
We’ll share the new layout for our most common objects including the Lead, Account, contact and Opportunity records.
Then, we’ll cover how to get to the setup for configuration and customization.
Let’s dive in!

Elements of the home page
An intelligent way to start your day fast
{}Speaker1:{}
WHEN YOU first login to salesforce, you will land on the home page.
Here are a few key areas I want to highlight:
On the left hand side is the collapsable Navigation Menu, which allows you to easily navigate through your business data and objects within your salesforce account.
In the top middle of the home page is a performance chart.
This area will help you monitor how close you are to reaching your sales performance goals.
Below the performance chart, you’ll find Account Insights, which provides updates and highlights about your most important accounts.
The far right hand side is labeled Assistant and helps sales reps identify exactly what they need to be doing today based on activity information .
At the very top you will see the Global Search Bar.
This is a powerful search engine that will guide you to records in Salesforce.
It is important to note you can use an “*” as a wild card in searches.
This new Lightning Experience home page is not yet customizable.
We know customers want the ability to modify what appears on this home page, and this flexibility will be added in a future release.
Also, not all of your objects will appear in the navigation menu.
To view more objects, let’s navigate directly to the App Launcher.
{}App Launcher{}
App Launcher
View all of your applications via the App Launcher
{}Speaker1:{}
Users can find applications by searching for the app name in the global search bar or by using the App Launcher.
(1) The App Launcher appears at the top right hand corner of every page.
(2) Click on the icon containing several small tiles, and this will bring up the App Launcher.
Apps display as large tiles and are labeled with (3) sales, marketing, and more.
Access to all custom objects, are located within the Other Items tile.

{}Speaker1:{}
There are several ways to find what you’re looking for fast.
When you click into the global search bar at the top of the page, you’ll see a drop down of your recently viewed items.
When you know what you’re looking for, you can begin typing and the search bar will try and match your search and display records that match your criteria.
The search function also displays your results placing your most frequently used objects at the top of the list.
List Views
See your data, your way, with easy filters and visualization tools
{}List View Charts{}
Visualize your lists on the fly with a bar or donut chart

{}Speaker1:{}
In Lightning Experience, when you access a specific object, you are taken directly to a list view.
You can manage your list views right from this page, use the Filter widget to add, set or remove filters and also get quick visualizations of your business data with Charts.
Using Setup
{}Speaker1:{}
To navigate to the setup menu, go to the upper right hand corner of every page and click on the Gear icon and select "Setup Home“ from the Quick Access Menu.
Our Setup page provides a streamlined interface for viewing and managing your administrative setup tasks.
The Quick Find (1) search lets you quickly navigate to any node using a keyword.
Quick Find is the best way to find what you're looking for if you know its name and it’s your power tool for getting where you need to go!

{}Opportunities{}
Any <fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;00A1E0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{}potential revenue-generating sales deal{} </fill-sd>or event you want to track.
{}Accounts{}
Organization with an <fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;00A1E0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{}established relationship</fill-sd>{} to your company.
{}Activities{}
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;00A1E0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{}A detailed interaction log</fill-sd>{} for a call, a follow-up task or a calendar event.
Our sales cloud standard objects in Salesforce includes Leads, accounts, contacts, opportunities and activities.
Let’s discuss each in more detail:
Leads are people who are interested in your products and services but have not yet purchased.
They are typically unqualified leads and generally come in from websites, events and purchased lists.
Often leads are the handoff mechanism between Marketing and Sales.
Accounts are companies that you have a relationship with, including:
Prospects, Customers, Partners and Competitors
Contacts are people associated with an Account that matter to your business.
Examples include:
Sponsor and Decision Makers, Influencers, Assistants and Partners.
Opportunities are potential revenue-generating sales deals that you wish to track through a sales process until the deal closes.
They are used to view pipeline and determine actions needed.
Activities are call logs, follow-up tasks, calendar events and emails associated with a managing your Leads, Contacts, Accounts and Opportunities.
The Fundamental Objects of a Sales Process
Demonstration
{}Convert the lead into an Account, Opportunity, & Contact{}
{}Add new opportunities & contacts to an account{}
{}Create a Lead & Associate a task{}
{}Track your opportunity through the sales process{}
Now, we’ll take you through a demonstration of a typical sales journey.
We’ll show you:
1) how to create a lead and associate a task to the lead,
How to qualify and covert the lead into an account, contact, and opportunity.
How to Track your opportunity through your sales process
And how create new contacts and opportunities within an account

{}Take audience through a typical sales journey.{}
I’m at my desk and I have an incoming call from our toll free number.
It is a person we haven’t done business with that is interested in our products.
I take the information down in our lead tab and create a follow-up task for a meeting scheduled tomorrow.
Create lead and create a new follow up Task.
{}Fast forward to tomorrow, I find out this is a great prospect, they have budget, our products are the right match so this is a qualified lead.{}
{}I update the task and mark it closed{}
Check all checkboxes (Product Interest, Budget, Approval) to qualify lead > SAVE > Then Close task

The reason we suggest setting up users at the beginning, is to help you assign your data appropriately as you are entering it into Salesforce.
Security basics for user setup
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;accent1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{}Role Hierarchy{} </fill-sd><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;3B3B3B&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">determines the level of visibility users have to records such as opportunities they don’t own</fill-sd>
Ensures that managers always have access to the same data as their employees
Usually mirrors your organization's structure
{}Sales Rep{}
{}Sales Manager{}
{}CEO{}
{}Sales Rep{}
{}Sales Rep{}
{}Sales Manager{}
{}Sales Manager{}
{}Central{}
{}West{}
{}East{}
You will see your own records and the records of your employees

When setting up users, you will need to create a role hierarchy and assign users to the roles.
Similar to an organization chart, a role hierarchy represents a level of data access that a user or group of users needs.
The role hierarchy ensures that users higher in the structure always have access to the same data as people lower in their structure.
Role hierarchies don’t have to match your organization chart exactly, but usually mirrors the general structure.
This is an item you should setup immediately.
There is more you can do with security however, this one step is our recommended task, set up your roles and then assign them to users when you create your users.
Steps to set-up users
Create role hierarchy
Enter users
Select appropriate profile and role

Make sure you fill out the user fields like title, company, phone numbers and address so any email templates you create later show their complete company information.
Follow these steps to set-up your users so they have access to Salesforce and so that they can be assigned to data as you enter it into Salesforce.
These steps are also included in the Getting Started Workbook, which may be downloaded with the link provided here.
</font>Here is a quick best practice, you can set up users with the “Read Only” profile which allows you to make them record owners but at the same time, they can login and start becoming familiar with Salesforce.

Key players are most directly involved in the details and are typically in charge of driving business process alignment efforts and overall implementation strategy and activities.

They will work closely with the system administrator, and help validate that salesforce is set up correctly to support their business objectives. </font></fill-sd></kern>
Supporting players are critical to the success of the implementation as well but play a more indirect role.
<font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}<animation4></font><kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}The Data Analyst is responsible for determining which data should be imported into salesforce.

Some of the best champions are sales reps who can help represent the needs of the people who will be using salesforce everyday. </font></fill-sd></kern>
<font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}<animation6></font><kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}Lastly, the Executive Sponsor drives the salesforce vision and communicates the strategy for what you want to accomplish.
Often they hold a senior leadership positions and encourage managers and end users to adopt Salesforce.
This role is critical.
Research indicates that having strong executive sponsorship is one of the top contributing factors to a successful implementation. </font></fill-sd></kern>
For mid to large-size companies, there are likely additional roles involved, such as integration leads, developers, and dedicated trainers.
And for smaller organizations, employees usually wear multiple hats.
For example, the role of executive sponsor and business process
owner could be the same person whose role is to own the strategy and make decisions on the business process.
{}Executive Sponsor{}
{}Business Process Owner{}
{}Champion(s){}

How should they participate?

Our getting started series was built to help new customers deploy salesforce and we’re often asked who should get involved in each area of the series.
Here are recommendations on which sessions are most applicable broken down by role.

Time to Value
Track Record of Success
Local Presence
Resources available to help to engage with a partner:
{}Speaker2:{}
Our recommendation is to engage with a certified implementation partner.
This has historically been the fastest path to success because partners have the skills and resources to get you up and running quickly.
Partners also have industry and product expertise, as well as connections to local resources who can assist you in person.
Engaging with a partner will increase your time to value.
Partners are flexible and can tailor an engagement to fit your requirements.
Some customers engage with partners for the entire implementation, from design to deployment.
Whereas others choose to leverage partners for a specific project or task.
For more information on where to find partners, visit our AppExchange and engage with your Account Executive.
We create a resource called Successfully Implement with Salesforce Partners.
This guide will help you understand the process of working with a partner and how to prepare.
Partners also typically help with launch strategy and planning - Communication, train the trainer, documentation etc. these are all things they can help you with but remember that you need to drive what you want from them.
Remember that some Partners simply come in and do the analysis and design while you execute if you have internal expertise.
There are many combinations of collaboration with partners.
We have a great resource for you to use that includes valuable advice when working with partners.
We recommend you view the materials from this training link on this slide!
You’ll find the link in the resource section of this deck.
Here is a quick story I want to share:
I worked with one customer that chose to self implement but hired a certified consultant for a fixed 20 hours.
The customer used that time to have the consultant validate processes, designs and train the sys administrator on how to implement and configure some of the more difficult tasks.
Gather Feedback
{}Speaker2:{}
Business users are stakeholders who should be involved from the planning phase through to deployment.
Let’s discuss how to gather feedback to drive a successful implementation.
{}Resistors have important information, don’t avoid them{}
Consider how people handle change
{}Neutrals{}
{}Resistors{}
What most people resist is being controlled – not change itself
Know your personalities
{}Champions{}
{}Early adopters{}
{}Speaker2:{}
Not everyone adapts to change easily, so understanding your users and how they will react is important.
Here are some examples of the types of learners you’ll likely confront and how they can help with the implementation:
1)  Early Adopters are great testers for your system.
They are comfortable with change and new technology, so make sure you utilize them for your testing process.
Champions are great trainers and advocates.
Often times they have been exposed to Salesforce and are very excited so utilize it again.
3)  The majority of your users will fall in the neutral bucket.
Make sure you work to have them provide feedback.
4)  And finally, resistors don’t like change.
However, they can help validate good design and drive success so listen to them and seek out their feedback.
{}Are you meeting your objectives?{}
{}Is your solution easy to use?{}
Form a change leadership team
Why
Help people fell consulted, not controlled
Evaluate and prioritize user requests
Form a team to provide ongoing feedback
Who
Invite early adopters and resistors to have a voice
Focus on individuals who are trusted <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;002044&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans Light&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans Light&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />by their peers
Ensure execs are included and informed
{}Speaker2:{}
We recommend forming a change leadership team to help drive a successful implementation.
This team will be responsible for analyzing and prioritizing feedback.
As we discussed earlier, you will confront users who will be resistant to change, so being proactive in listening and actioning feedback provides several benefits:
If users feel they have been consulted from the beginning, versus mandated to adopt, it will drive more commitment to the project.
Your change management team can evaluate and prioritize these requests to make sure feedback is being heard
and make sure this is an ongoing part of the process.
This group of individuals will be your standing team of consultants to help you evaluate and plan as you evolve Salesforce.
When you think about who should participate, you want to invite your early adopters and resistors to make sure everyone has a voice.
Make sure the people selected are respected and trusted by their peers
And be sure your executive team is included and informed on progress.
For smaller organizations, your team might be comprised of your system administrator, your executive sponsor or business owner and some key users.
For a larger organization, you’ll want to ensure all parties are represented but that your team doesn’t become so large that you can’t make decisions easily.
{}Have users validated their business processes within Salesforce?{}
Develop your validation process

Enlist your early adopters and resistors!) </font>
Document the validation approach.
Provide a test environment.
{}Speaker2:{}
Make sure you include user acceptance testing as part of your plan.
In addition to technical testing, test the entire business process.
We refer to this as end to end testing.
Write up a couple real-life business scenarios your users will confront once they're live on salesforce, and use those as test scripts.
For example, you’ll test your sales process using opportunities.
Start by creating an opportunity.
Are the sale stages correct?
Are the fields easy to navigate?
Is there a field where adding help text would make it more clear on what data is needed?
Here are some example questions to ask your testing team:
Was there any point where you were unsure of what to do next?
Was there any point where you completed a step and something unexpected happened?
Customers on Enterprise edition or above you have access to a sandbox environment for testing.
If you are on Professional edition or below, consider creating a test user for this validation process which you can later deactivate.

Be sure to download the Getting Started workbook from the resource link available below this video.
I includes a section that helps you outline your validation plan.
The workbook will help you define quickly the key considerations when you build out this plan.
Now {}<Speaker1>{} is going to discuss the importance of communication and getting the word out to your team.
Get the word out
{}Speaker1:{}
Project communication is one of the most important aspects of a successful CRM implementation.
Communication helps drive adoption by providing an understanding of:
What challenges Salesforce is solving
What benefits will be gained
What is needed from end users
And what end users need to know
{}Sponsor Engagement{}
{}Teaser Emaii{}
Building Phase
(Pre-Launch)
{}Launch Announcement{}
{}Sponsor and Champion Participation{}
Awareness Phase
(Week of Launch)
{}Teaser Email{}
{}Launch Recap{}
{}Sponsor Status Meeting{}
{}User Contest{}

(Post Launch)
Communicate with your users
Builds enthusiasm
Keeps your users updated
For High Impact:
Executive Sponsor Communicates
{}Speaker1:{}
We recommend developing a communication plan to build enthusiasm for the project.
Here are some examples broken down in phases.
For the build phase, engage your sponsors and champions to start promoting the project and upcoming launch.
Send out teaser emails stating some benefits end users will achieve with salesforce.
These communications are about creating buzz and excitement for what’s to come.
{}<animation 1>{}
The awareness phase is to announce the upcoming launch of salesforce to your end users.
Keep them informed by communicating the plan and timeline through kick off meetings and hosted office hours.
Invite your sponsors and champions to participate in these sessions to show their support publicly.
Ask the key users from your change leadership team to help communicate updates to their parts of the business.
This ensures you get wider buy-in and awareness.
Let your sponsors and champions help build engagement and energy!
And don’t forget to engage your executive sponsor to make an announcement and show their support of the project.
This will be a high impact message to the team.
{}<animation 2>{}
Finally, build a plan for post launch to keep the communication going.
Provide updates on end user adoption.
Continue to have your executive sponsors explain the value they are achieving.
Schedule status meetings with sponsors and key stakeholders to report progress and maintain their engagement.
You can even design user contests to generate excitement, adoption, and commitment to the project.

We provided a sample communication plan within the Getting Started Workbook to help you get a jump start on building out your own plan.
Documenting when and how you will communicate will help align the team on the overall communication strategy.
{}Collaboration in Action{}
{}Key Files to Share{}
{}Additional Files Shared{}
Best Practice:
Collaborate right from the start
Chatter Quickstart
{}Speaker1:{}
We also recommend creating a chatter group dedicated to your salesforce project.
Chatter is a natural fit to help with the rollout by providing  one central location to consolidate all collateral and conversation around the project.
Use this group to share important milestones and timelines.
Upload all training documents and collateral used to support the launch.
As an Administrator, you can upload resources and communicate your training plan through chatter.
Encourage users to share feedback and ask questions within the group in order to capture all conversation in this central location.
This also makes it clear to users where they need to go to find resources, get information, and ask questions related to the project.
By introducing users to Chatter early on, they’ll immediately understand the benefits of collaboration in Salesforce.
Creating a Chatter group is easy.
We’ll share how to create a chatter group in the demonstration chapter of this Prepare video series.
And to learn more about Chatter, review the Chatter quickstart page which is included in the resource deck directly below this video.
Meet the new user experience in Salesforce
{}Speaker1:{}
We are now going to hop into a demo but First, I want to take a moment to introduce our re-vamped user interface, called Lightning Experience.
Lightning was recently released in October 2015 and is primarily focused on providing sales users a more productive interface.
{}Speaker1:{}
When you first log in to salesforce, do you see a vertical navy bar displaying icons running down the left side of the screen?
If yes, you are on the Lightning experience.
{}Speaker1:{}
If you log on and instead see a horizontal row of tabs across the top of your screen, then you are on Salesforce Classic.
General navigation is different in Lightning versus Classic.
We’ve included video demonstrations in both the classic and lightning experience, so be sure to watch the one that’s most relevant to you.

Identify and prioritize goals
{}Speaker1:{}
Once you’ve opened the lines of communication in your organization you’ll be able to clearly identify and prioritize your goals.
{}<animation1>{}The first thing you want to address are your pain points and challenges at your company.
{}<animation2>{}Answer questions to uncover these challenges, like what obstacles are impacting revenue generation, or how can we improve our sales processes?
{}<animation3>{}Next,  identify and prioritize your goals to begin building your roadmap.  This prioritization step is often missed, but very important.
Each goal your team creates should be ranked in terms of importance and impact to the business.
Then, priority is agreed upon across the key stakeholders.
{}<animation4>{}From your goals you will have business priorities, such as winning more deals or increasing sales rep efficiency.
And finally define how and what you will measure in salesforce to understand if you are achieving your goals.
Identify and prioritizing goals and how you will measure progress is a collaborative effort across the entire team.

Let’s walk through an example.
{}<animation1>{}We start by articulating our pain point and challenge.
We know we’re losing deals to competitors, but we don’t know who or why.
We want the ability to track competitors in our sales process and build a strategy on how to better position our products and services against these competitors.
{}<animation2>{}Our goal is to enable our reps to capture who they are competing against, and why we lose the deal.
{}<animation3>{}This is a top priority across our organization as we strive to win more deals and increase are revenue.

Measure your success
{}Speaker1:{}
Once your goals and priorities are defined, it is important to create a plan on how you will measure implementation success.
Metrics can be tracked from the beginning and provide guidance around what’s working well and identify areas for improvement.
Why measure success?
{}Measurement is crucial for your{} {}implementation success!{}
Know what’s working and what’s not
Justify your investment
Reward desired behavior
Ensure the expected value
{}Speaker1:{}
Measurement is crucial for the adoption of business systems like Salesforce.
You need quantifiable results so that you have something tangible to report back to the business showing the value obtained from Salesforce.
Create metrics that track end user adoption and measure against your goals to gain insight on progress.
Keep this data within the context of the use cases you identified at the beginning of the process.
Measurement helps you know what’s working and what’s not.
Adoption and success will evolve.
Data analysis can help you identify areas that need adjustment and the team can prioritize based on importance.
For example, if you’re using salesforce to drive pipeline, you can measure the volume of new opportunities being created.
If it seems low, the team can proactively reach out to sales, uncover blockers, then drive improvements.
This information is essential in helping your stakeholders justify their investment.
They want to be assured that the expected business value is achieved.
For example, are you closing deals faster, finding competitor information quickly?
It also provides an opportunity to reward desired behaviors.
You can reward your power users to encourage adoption.
You have invested in Salesforce as a business tool, are you realizing your goals?
Are you receiving the value you expect from the system?

{}Measure Business Performance{}
Engagement
Productivity
Effectiveness
{}Speaker1:{}
Next, let’s walk through some examples of what to measure.
We’ve broken this into 3 categories: engagement, productivity, and effectiveness.
Success metrics will evolve over time, but at the start of your deployment, you will want to understand how users are adopting the system and track the quality of data being entered.
We have Adoption and Data Quality Dashboards available for download on the AppExchange.
These prebuilt dashboards include reports and dashboard components that allows you track metrics like:
who’s logging in? how many opportunities or activities records are being created? is there data missing with opportunities?
This insight allows your Salesforce team to track progress and measure adoption.
We’ll cover how to download dashboards from the appexchange in the demonstration video in the next chapter.
{}<animation 1> {}It’s important to gather feedback.
We shared in chapter 2 how you can track feedback through using a chatter group.
You can also explore using a formal survey with your users to get feedback and measure overall sentiment.
Are users satisfied with salesforce?
Can they collaborate easily?
Can they find content?
Are they closing deals faster?
Capturing this type of insight is best suited for a survey.
There are a number of survey tools available on the appexchange.
{}<animation 2> {}Effectiveness relates to company specific key performance indicators.
These are concrete business metrics that will resonate with a CEO, CFO, or a business manager and they are unique to every company.
For example, a sales-driven company may tie success to decreasing the length of the sales cycle or increasing win rates against competitors.
Your company will decide which metrics you want to measure to understand how salesforce is impacting the business.
We cover examples in the Enable your user experience with data session, where we talk through prebuilt reports and dashboards that can give you a jump start on analytics.

{}Update workbook with priority categories, etc.{}
Earlier, we used the Getting Started Workbook to outline our business goals and how we would measure success.
Now, use the workbook to document how you’ll measure progress by identifying what adoption means to your organization and how you will measure it.
Typically, customers take a phased approach to analyzing adoption.
It’s important to have quick wins that provide encouragement to users, so make your goals realistic and attainable so you can celebrate achievements and milestones.

Define your sales process
{}Speaker1:{}
Outlining your basic sales process is one of your first steps as you implement Salesforce.
This will help you define much of what you will configure in salesforce, from custom fields and sales stages to page layouts and reporting needed.
The Fundamental Objects of a Sales Process
Leads
Accounts
Contacts
Opportunities
Activities
{}Speaker1:{}
Before we start, let’s talk about the sales cloud standard objects in Salesforce.
Leads, accounts, contacts, opportunities, let’s go into more detail
What is a Lead?
{}Leads{}
The people interested in your products or services
{}Sources{}
Where you get your leads
{}Activities{}
Actions like tasks, calls, and events
{}Speaker1:{}
Leads are people who are interested in your products and services but have not purchased before or it they may indicate an opportunity to sell to an existing customer.
Generally, these come in from websites, events and purchased lists, often these are the handoff mechanism between Marketing and Sales.
They are often used by Inside Sales to facilitate qualification of potential deals
They’re fundamental to performing any kind of marketing ROI analysis
They’re separate from your company's Accounts, Contacts, and Opportunities
They’re necessary to take advantage of the Salesforce anti-duplication utility
You will want to track lead sources to understand the best source for your leads, ROI, etc.
You will also want to track the activities associated with the lead to understand where a lead is cold, what actions are driving conversions, etc.
Define your Lead Process
Map Your Process to Salesforce CRM Functionality
Map your ideal process to Salesforce CRM and establish the names you give to your data elements and the fields in Salesforce CRM.
Determine how you will measure and track
How you will measure conversion and top performers?
Determine how Leads will be assigned and qualified
How do you manage unassigned leads?
Identify Lead sources
Where do leads come from?
So here are the steps you should follow to build your processes around leads
Where do your leads come from?
• You probably will acquire leads by importing, creating manually, or automatically capturing them from your website.
<Animation 1> Next, How will you assign and qualify your leads?
You’ll need to determine the process where leads are assigned and qualified so think about that.
<Animation 2> You’ll want to determine how you will measure and track your leads
For example, how will you measure conversion and top performers
<kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;-112&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;MS PGothic&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;-128&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;ＭＳ Ｐゴシック&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;-112&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;-128&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;"><Animation 3> And then finally, you will map this lead process to salesforce functionality.</font></fill-sd></kern>
Use the Getting Started workbook to help with this mapping.

{}(Deal Information){}
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;074051&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Company </fill-sd><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;002044&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Information</fill-sd>
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;002044&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Contact </fill-sd><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;074051&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Information</fill-sd>
Deal Information
Lead Conversion
<size val="1100">{}Speaker1</size>:{}
<animation 1> Once the lead is a qualified opportunity, it is converted.
<animation 2>
<animation 3> The company information such as brand name and location are captured on the account.
<animation 4> The contact information such as individual name and email are captured on the contact.
<animation 5> And the deal information such as potential revenue, anticipated close date are captured on the opportunity.
Let’s dig into each of those standard objects.
What is an Account?
{}Accounts{}
Companies that you have a relationship with
{}Partners{}
Customers
Competitors
{}Prospects{}
<size val="1100">{}Speaker1</size>:{}
Accounts are companies that you have a relationship with, including:
Prospects – these are organizations that are not yet customer but you’re working a deal
Customers – these are organizations that have purchased goods and/or services from you
Partners – these are organizations that work with you to sell goods and/or services
And Competitors – these are organizations where you want to track who you compete against for business
What is a Contact?
{}Contacts{}
People in an account who matter to your business
{}Decision makers{}
Partners
Influencers
{}Assistants{}
<size val="1100">{}Speaker1</size><km val="0"><strike val="noStrike"><kern val="0"><cap val="none"><spc val="0"><normh val="0"><ln val="&lt;a:ln&gt;&lt;a:noFill/&gt;&lt;/a:ln&gt;"><eff-l val="&lt;a:effectLst/&gt;"><ul-f val="&lt;a:uLnTx/&gt;"><fill-uf val="&lt;a:uFillTx/&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;-112&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;MS PGothic&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;-128&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;ＭＳ Ｐゴシック&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;-112&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;-128&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">:</font></fill-uf></ul-f></eff-l></ln></normh></spc></cap></kern></strike></km>{}
Contacts are people associated with an Account that matter to your business.
Examples include:
Sponsor/Decision Makers
Influencers
Assistants
Partner Liaisons
What is an Opportunity?
{}Opportunities{}
Potential revenue-generating deals
{}Forecast Revenue{}
Generate Pipeline
{}Track Deals{}
<size val="1100">{}Speaker1</size><kern val="0">:</kern>{}
Opportunities are:
Potential revenue-generating sales deals that you wish to track through a sales process until the deal closes.
They are used to view pipeline and determine actions needed (for example more leads into the funnel; deals staying too long at a certain stage).
Opportunities are set up with consistent opportunity stages and probability to allow you to forecast sales by projected close dates.
Define your Sales Process
Map Your Process to Salesforce CRM Functionality
Map your ideal process to Salesforce CRM and establish the names you give <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1700&quot;&gt;&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;002044&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />to your data elements and the fields in Salesforce CRM.
Determine how you will measure and track
How you will measure win/loss ratios, won deals to quotas & top performers?
Determine your sales stages
What are the sequential steps your sales reps will go through as they manage their opportunities?
Define when an opportunity will be created
When a Lead is qualified, when does a sales rep create an opportunity?
Next is building your sales process.
We’ve given you some background.
You should have a common framework or a common language to manage the Sales Activities that drive sales performance.
You will want to identify the decision steps along the way that indicate when an opportunity should be created and then how to manage the sales process.
How you sell should determine how you configure salesforce.
At what point do you want your sales reps to create an opportunity?
That’s one of the first things that you should decide.
<Animation 1> Next, what are the sales stages you use, the defaults in salesforce can be changed to map to your process so what are the stages, that’s for you to decide and configure
<Animation 2> After your sales stages, make sure you identify how and what you will track for reporting and analysis.
<Animation 3> And then finally, you will map your sales process to salesforce functionality to complete your solution.
Use the Getting Started workbook to help with this mapping.
Qualification
Best Practice:
Define your sales process
Getting Started Workbook
Qualification
Discovery
Proposal
Negotiation
Won/Lost
{}My Sales Stage (SAMPLE){}
Stages
Enter this stage when:
Lead
Individual is not a current customer and interest is not confirmed
Qualification
Individual has been contacted and expressed interest
Discovery
Interactions to understand individual needs for a particular deal are in progress
Proposal
Proposal/quote is getting developed
Negotiation
Individual has proposal and has not made decision
Closed- Won/Lost
Individual accepts/rejects proposal
Here is a typical sales process from lead to closed won or lost.
<Animations >:
1) Your first contact with many customers will be as a lead.
Once qualified, they move to
2) Discovery, understanding timing, budget, who approves, products/services the customer is interested in, etc.
3) Next, you’ll probably prepare the initial quote or proposal
4) After that most deals will run through a negotiation process
5) Finally, you will mark the deal as closed won or lost
<Animation>You not only can adjust the stage names within Salesforce, you may also add or remove stages to align to your sales process.
Your opportunity stage values are one of the first things you should adjust in salesforce.
Your stages should reflect your sales process rather than the salesforce defaults.
We’ve provided recommended stages and definitions in the Getting Started workbook.
Take the time to agree on these stages within your organization, then adjust Salesforce to match your process.

{}Convert Lead{}
{}Speaker1:{}
Now that you know what the salesforce objects are that are involved in your sales processes, let’s talk about the end to end sales process.
<animation 1> Typically, an organization will bring interested prospects in by creating a lead
<animation 2> Next you’ll gather information about that lead
<animation 3> Eventually you may disqualify that lead, if it isn’t the right fit or does not have the potential for a sale
<animation 4> If you discover this is a qualified lead, one that you want to move into a formal sales process, you will convert that prospect to an account and contact with an opportunity.
You’ll have various activities along the way as you work with that customer
<animation 5> Ultimately, you’ll monitor and track the sales process along the way to either a won or lost opportunity
What you will want to discover are the decision points that occur during a sales cycle and map out these processes.
Create a seamless user experience
{}Speaker1 (if two speakers, Speaker2):{}
Simplifying the salesforce screens and layout makes the entire rollout of salesforce successful for your organization.
We are going to share some simple best practices that have a huge impact on adoption by your users.
What’s great about salesforce is how much you can easily configure.
Best Practice:
Modify Standard Fields
Define the adjustments to standard fields
Hide unnecessary fields <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;074051&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />and related lists
Set required fields
Update pick list values
Set default values
Utilize help text to <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;074051&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />guide users

Standard Fields in salesforce were designed to be flexible, and leave a lot of room for you to customize them and make them more useful to your instance.
Here’s a few things you can do to make standard fields work for you:
Use the Getting Started workbook to view the standard fields for the core sales objects.
We’ve provided a checklist for the recommended standard field changes within the workbook.
Let me walk through this checklist to give you some pointers.
Determine what adjustments you want to make to the fields to align to your business.
Fields that are not applicable to your business should be hidden to minimize data entry for your users and to avoid confusion.
Set required fields for fields that drive any reporting or processes.
Update pick list values so that the values shown in your dropdown are applicable.
This helps to minimize scrolling for your end users when entering data and helps to improve data quality.
Set default values where relevant.
It is common to set stages to default to the first stage.
And, finally, utilize help text for key fields where your users could benefit from additional guidance.
We recommend adding help text to your opportunity stage field to define each stage criteria.
This helps improve data quality and to minimize the questions you may receive from users when they start to use Salesforce.
Best Practice:
Add Custom Fields
Define custom fields needed
Add custom fields
Understand the value of formula fields
Leverage data types available
Adjust field location
Create validation rules (as appropriate)
Help & Training:
Creating Custom Fields
To tailor salesforce to fit your unique requirements, you can add custom fields for each of the tabs and objects that your organization uses.
There are several types of fields you can create, like a checkbox, a date field, and a text field.
Your Salesforce edition type will determine the amount of custom fields you can create.
After you have analyzed your needs, create the custom fields you will need to hold the data your team needs to enter
Utilize formula fields where possible, fields derived from other values.
An example would be bringing the account type down to the opportunity so you can see the account type on the opportunity but you don’t need to enter it.
Spend some time understanding the different data types available for custom fields, it is important you choose the right data type, text, currency, number, etc.
Another tip is to consider field location.
You want fields to be shown in the order the user will typically enter the data.
Group relevant fields together and keep your most important, required fields towards the top of the page.
Finally, as appropriate, you should consider creating validation rules.
These help to enforce data required based on other information entered.
For example, you would not want to allow a deal to move to closed-lost without capturing the loss reason.
We’ve provided some common custom fields for consideration in the Getting Started workbook.
Best Practice:
Organize your pages
Change field locations
Create new sections
Use meaningful section headers
Customize related lists
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;002060&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Help & Training:
</fill-sd><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;00A1E0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><lnk-c val="&lt;a:hlinkClick r:id=&quot;rId3&quot;/&gt;">Customizing Page Layouts with the Enhanced Page Layout Editor</lnk-c></fill-sd>
Let’s go over page layouts in detail.
A page layout allows you to arrange fields on the pages for each object in a particular order.
Page layouts control:
The layout and organization of Detail and Edit pages
Which fields, custom links, and related lists users see
Which standard and custom buttons display on detail pages and related lists.
And whether fields are visible, read only, or required.
Here are the steps we recommend:
Change field locations to have them make sense
Create new sections
Make sure you use meaningful section headers.
Customize related lists so you see the fields people want to see
One thing to note, for our Contact Manager, Group Edition, and Professional Edition customers, every user views the same layout.
Enterprise and above editions can create different page layouts for use by different profiles and record types, and set field-level security settings to further restrict users’ access to specific fields.
Best Practice:
Adapt Search Fields

This setup in salesforce is important for usability for your users and often overlooked!
Search layouts allow you to select the standard and custom fields that are displayed in salesforce’s search features.
This is a must-do to setup for each object in salesforce, don’t just use the defaults!
You are ensuring user adoption by testing their experience.
Validate your solution
Build a test scenario for your processes
Provide a test environment
Test your business processes

Demonstration presented on new Lightning Experience
We recently launched a new user interface called the Lightning experience.
This interface is primarily focused on making sales users more productive through enhanced ease of navigation, data entry, and usability.
When you log in to your salesforce instance, do you see a vertical navy bar displaying icons running down the left side of the screen?
If yes, you are on the new Lightning experience.
This video demonstration will be shown using the new lightning environment, but we also offer a video for customers still on our Classic user interface.
Classic Experience
If you log on to salesfore and instead see a horizontal row of tabs across the top of your screen, then you are on Salesforce Classic.
Classic Experience – Demo & Set-up Series

Deciding If Lightning Experience is Right For You
For our Salesforce Classic customers, <animation 1>we have the same demonstration in our “Classic” environment.
To access, navigate to the right side of this video screen to expose the additional chapters of the series.
Scroll down and look for the video chapter labeled as ‘Classic Demo’.
<animation 2> We also have our Set-up Salesforce series.
We created demonstration videos where saleforce experts guide you through completing baseline customization tasks, such as setting up users or leads.
After watching the demonstration, you can access a step by step walkthrough which takes you directly in to your instance of salesforce to perform the task.
These walkthroughs are not currently supported in our new lightning experience user interface, but accessible in Classic.
All customers can enable or disable the lightning experience for their salesforce instance.
For more information on the lightning and classic user interfaces, we encourage customers to take a look at our Trailhead resource entitled Deciding If Lightning Experience Is Right for You.

{}Introduction{}
Let’s demo some of the great features we just discussed.
I want to put them in context when we say design with the end in mind so let’s discuss a simple business scenario.
Our company wants to do a better job taking action early against competitors so that deals are not lost.
We’ve designed a business process where opportunities are marked with a competitor and sales representatives and sales management identify and take action earlier when competing for a deal.
{}Here are the competitor tracking requirements:{}
{}-{}Ability to capture the competitor while entering or editing the opportunity.
-Ability to access “At Risk” deals report to show deals at risk by competitor.

{}We’ve decided to add competitors as an Account and mark them with a value of “Competitor” in the type field as part of the design.{}
{}From our recommendations in part 2 we will show you how to:{}
-Create a new field on the opportunity page to add the Competitor
-Modify search changes for the Global Search results page so we can see that field called Type in our searches
-Modify the opportunity page layout with a Sales Process section

Key considerations when importing and managing your data
{}Speaker2:{}
Let’s first begin with understanding the resources and tools to help you implement salesforce.
Importing your data:
Overview
Data Import Video Series
List your data sources and the names of the fields in which data is stored
{}Outlook{}
{}ACT{}
{}Legacy CRM{}
{}Gmail{}
{}Excel{}
{}Export File{}
Analyze and identify any potential problems <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;2000&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />with your data
Resolve issues and cleanse the data prior to import into salesforce
{}Speaker2:{}
To start, you need to identify what data you want to migrate, and understand where the data is coming from.
Common data repositories are legacy CRM systems, email, or excel spreadsheets.
<Animation 1> Data from these systems can be exported into a Comma-separated value format.
<Animation 2>
First, you need to identify the data you want migrate and understand the field names and properties of the data.
<Animation 3> Next, analyze the data and ask yourself and the team some key questions:
Do all records need to be migrated?
For example, do you plan to migrate old activities or archive them?
Does the data need to be cleaned or modified?
Have you removed duplicates?
<Animation 4>
Remember, dirty data in means dirty data out.
Be thoughtful and analyze the data you decide to import.
Take the time to resolve any issues with your import file to ensure you migrate a clean data set into Salesforce.
We highly encourage you to view the Data Import Series, which is located in the resources section of this video.
This 5 part video series covers in detail ways to clean your import file, prepare the file for upload, and prepare salesforce to receive the data.
Preparing your data for import

{}Speaker2:{}
Once you’re ready to begin importing data, realize that it isn’t necessary to import all of your data at the same time.
We recommend you start with the foundations that allow you to be up and running
<animation1> Accounts and contacts should be your first phase.
<animation2>In addition, any “open” records that may need action should be imported, like open opportunities or leads.
<animation3> You likely want to provide visibility of past actions associated with your account and contact records.
For these historical records, like closed opportunities or cases, import this data based on your reporting needs.
<animation4> You can archive any data that doesn’t need to live in salesforce and keep it for future reference if needed.
<animation 5> and finally, always run small test files for every import!
Load 5-10 records as a test run to ensure the import runs smoothly.
Be sure to view the cleaning and preparing Your Data Video within the 3444, for more information
Examine your import
Examine your data prior to import and correct errors.
Data Import Video Series
{}Speaker2:{}
Duplicates are a major issue for many customers.
Not only does it mean work for the administrator to clean up, but it makes it difficult for your users to find the right information.
(1) Here is a common example.
We see Grand Hotels & Resorts listed as Limited and as LTD.
This would create two unique account records for what should be one account.
Bad data impacts user productivity and hurts the credibility of the system.
Gaining the trust of your user is critical for adoption, and providing good data is a big part of that trust.
Take the time to clean and remove duplicates prior to import.
(2) The Data Import series has a video dedicated to help guide you through cleaning up your import file.
Prepare for import and data import tools
{}Speaker2:{}
Now, let’s discuss how to prepare for the import and introduce the data import tools available.
Prepare your import file
Prepare your files to facilitate the import process.
‘Preparing Your Data for Import’ Article
{}Checklist{}
Use Salesforce field names
Include the record owner ID
Populate required fields
Use valid picklist values
Include an import batch field
Add Created By and Created Date fields
Include legacy system data ID
{}Speaker2:{}
Importing your data requires you to prepare your import files.
The file you plan to import into salesforce is called your source file.
Once you’ve removed duplicates, you’ll want to prepare your source file to help make the import process run smoothly.
Here’s a quick checklist:
Rename the columns in your file to match Salesforce field names.
Be sure to include a column for record owner ID, as records imported will need be assigned to a user in your system
Make sure to populate data for all of your required fields.
If you’re importing a picklist field , make sure all the picklist values match those available in Salesforce.
It can be very helpful to associate records to a specific source file, especially when you’re doing multiple imports.
Create a new field called ‘import batch’ and assign it a value tied to your source file.
This allows you to easily select imported records from a particular batch in case you need to delete, re-import, or simply identify where the data originally came from.
Add Created By and Created Date fields
You can also include the legacy ID for each record.
This is a useful way to tie your legacy data from another CRM system to salesforce.
For additional help, review the Preparing your Data for Import article within the help and training portal.
We'll include a direct link
within our resources link below this video.

‘<lnk-c val="&lt;a:hlinkClick r:id=&quot;rId3&quot;/&gt;">Preparing Your Data for Import’ Article</lnk-c>
{}Checklist{}
Identify required fields
Create custom fields
Add valid picklist values
Add a field for legacy system data ID
Open Created By and Created Date fields<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />(open a case with Salesforce support for access)
Use formula fields when possible
{}Speaker2:{}
You’ll also want to make sure your Salesforce application is ready for the import.
Make sure all the fields you need to migrate from your source file are available in Salesforce.
Here’s a quick checklist:
Identify your required fields.
Create custom fields in salesforce as needed if none of the standard fields map to the data you’re importing.
Add or edit picklist values so they match the data in your source file.
If you’re migrating data from a legacy CRM system, make sure to create a custom field to store this legacy ID within Salesforce.
When you create new records, salesforce automatically sets the create date to the current date and the created by field is the user doing the import.
If you are importing from another CRM system, you’ll likely want to preserve the original record creator and creation date for this legacy data.
To do this, contact salesforce support and request to have the audit fields feature enabled.
This will allow you to override the default behavior and import records with their original Created By and Creation Dates.
This only works on record creation and not while  updating records.
Remember to use formula fields as well to avoid duplicate data entry
Data Import Wizard
Use the Data Import Wizard when:
You are loading fewer than <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />50,000 records
The object you need to import is supported by the Data Import Wizard
You want to prevent duplicates for Accounts, Contacts, Leads
Data Import Video Series
{}Speaker2:{}
We’ve shared how to prepare your source file and salesforce for the import.
Now, we’ll share two main tools salesforce offers for completing a one-time import of your data , The Data Import Wizard and the Data Loader.
The Data Import Wizard is run through the application and here are a few things to consider to decide which tool best fits your needs.
The import wizard is best used when working with smaller data loads, less than 50,000 records.
Make sure the objects you need to import  are supported by the data import wizard
We recommend using the Data Import Wizard to import Account and Contact data, as it is able to prevent duplicates from being created.
View the Data Import Series for additional guidance on Choosing the right tool.

Data Loader
‘Deciding on A Method for Importing Data’ Article
Data Import Video Series
Use Data Loader* when:
You need to import 50,000 to 5,000,000 records
You need to load into an object that <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />is not supported by the import wizards
You want to schedule regular <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />data loads
You want to export your data for backup purposes
{}Speaker2:{}
The second tool is called The Data Loader which is an API-based tool.
Here are some highlights of the tool:
The data loader is best used for importing large volumes of data (50,000 and more).
It’s commonly used to load data for objects not supported by the Data Import Wizards
The data loader also has the ability to schedule regular data loads
And the ability to export data for back up purposes.
The Data loader is available for Enterprise, Unlimited and Performance edition customers by default, and can be enabled for Professional edition customers when necessary for your implementation.
Contact support to have the data loader feature turned on.
Be sure to view the Data Import Series and our knowledge base article on Deciding on a method for importing data.

Import using Import My Accounts and Contacts
{}Speaker1:{}
{}Demo script – LEX UI:{}
{}These are the features I will be demonstrating:{}
A quick overview of a data import
Using Gmail as a source for an Accounts/Contact import file
I will discuss a few common issues that create duplicate Accounts during the data import process
Then I will demonstrate using the Data Import Wizard to import Accounts with Contacts and I will discuss a best practices around importing your Accounts and Contacts
{}Exporting data from data sources (Gmail contacts):{}
-Open browser to your Gmail’s Contacts section
-Show the Business Contacts folder that will have specific group of contacts to import into salesforce.
-Above the Contact list click More > Export > select “The Group ( Contact Folder  )” and specify folder
-Select Export format Outlook CSV as it is the easiest format to work with.
This will create a file that I will use for the import.
{}CSV File preparation best practices:{}
-Export the gmail contacts and open the .csv file
-Remove columns with no data or data your not going to import and just basically explain that any external system (eg. Gmail, linkedin, goldmine) can export data out to .csv format.
{}Open a sample .CSV file:{}
{}-{}Show/Explain Batch id field in column A, using the current date as a unique value.
“This is the field that I will use to relate an imported record to the import file this record originated from.
Here is the prepared file with the fields removed and the Batch ID column added.
-Explain each column and what type of field is being populated.
-Quick tip:
Mention Excel has a “Remove Duplicates” option and how it can be used
-Show Account duplicates “Grand Hotels & Resorts Ltd” & “Limited” and explain that two different records will not be created but 2 new contacts (John and Sam) will be created (Sample csv file: http://sforce.co/1Fq8D9l)
{}Ready for import of Accounts and Contacts using Data Import Wizard (DIW):{}
-Setup> Data Management > Data Import wizard (DIW)
-Data Import video series can be accessed right from the DIW page.  (review before starting)
-Click Launch Wizard and then select Accounts and Contacts > Add New records
Match Contacts by:
Email   ,   Match Account by:
Account Name & Account Site  (keep Trigger Workflows..
Unchecked)
Select CSV and Browse or Drag sample CSV to the wizard > Next
Map necessary fields including “Unique Batch” with “Account:
Import Batch” > Next
Click Start Import > OK
Explain the Bulk Load results page
Go to Accounts Tab and open “Today’s Accounts” List view and show all the new accounts/contact that were imported.
Explain why “sForce” and “Grand Hotels & Resorts Limited” was not imported as a dupes due to the match rule settings.
{}Mass Delete Accounts / Contacts:{}
In case your import had all errors you might want to back track and delete the records so you can use the Mass Delete tool.
Account Tab > Tools section > Mass Delete Accounts and show how to Mass Delete Today’s accounts based on the unique Import Batch field value as a criteria
Go through and Delete all the accounts (this will also delete the related Contact records)
{}Demo alternate Tool – Import Accounts/Contacts:{}
First explain the difference of when you’d use DIW vs. Import Accounts/Contacts vs. Data Loader.
(Send audience this link from Help & Training to show the limits of each import tool: https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=import_which_data_import_tool.htm&language=en_US)
{}Difference:{}

Good Data Management
‘<lnk-c val="&lt;a:hlinkClick r:id=&quot;rId3&quot;/&gt;">Validation Rule Article</lnk-c>
{}Speaker1:{}
During Chapter 1, we shared the importance of migrating clean data into salesforce.
(1) Once it's imported, you need a strong data management strategy to make sure the data stays clean and up to date.
The first step is to train your users to enter clean data with simple and easily repeatable steps.
Here are a few tips:
(2) Train your users to input quality data
(3 ) Standardize your data by using naming & address conventions
(4) And Prevent duplicates by making sure users search for records before creating new ones that may already exist in your database.
(5) Another aspect of good data management is enforcing the right behavior through configuration in salesforce.
There are a number of good customization options including:
(6)  The ability to create fields that are required on the page layout
(7) Using  picklist fields versus open text fields to give users a defined set of data points to choose from
(8) And using Validation rules to verify that the data a user enters in a record meets the standards you specify before that record can be saved.
A validation rule can be a formula or expression that checks the data and displays an error message to the user if the data entered doesn’t match what you want it to be.
(9) The help & traning portal has useful articles on validiation rules, including example rules and formulas you can utilize.
We included links to these assets within the resources document which you can download directly below this video.

You can adjust these reports and dashboards to monitor the data that’s important to your organization.
Best Practice:
Archive and Back up
{}Data Archive{}
Data you will not migrate
Storage plan for  import files
Data you will archive in Salesforce
{}Data Back up{}
Weekly Data Export Service
{}Included with Enterprise Edition and above{}
Export data using Salesforce Reports
Data back up options available on the  AppExchange
‘Exporting Backup Data’ Article
{}Speaker1:{}
There are 2 additional best practices we would like to share, Archiving data and Backing up your data.
<animation 1>
We recommend developing a plan around how and when you will archive data.
Before the initial import, decide what data will not be imported and archive that data in case you need to reference it in the future.
Next, have a plan for storing your import files.
And as you think about maintaining your data over time, decide if you will develop a plan to archive data that lives within salesforce.
Often customers remove leads after a certain period of time or activities older than X number of years.
<animation>
We also encourage you to develop a plan to back up your data to make sure you are protected from any internal mistakes that may occur.
We recommend performing a weekly export of your data.
Or, if you run a data project in the future, be sure to back up your data before you start.
Here are a few options to export your data:
The weekly export service is available for Enterprise edition customers and above.
This service allows organizations to export a complete set of their salesforce data including all attachments for archival purposes.
A system administrator can request a data export once every seven (7) days.
For our Professional edition customers, you can purchase this weekly export service for an additional fee.
Another option is to generate key data reports in salesforce and export to a CSV file.
This can be an effective backup for customers who do not have the weekly export service.
And Other options are available from third party partners on the Appexchange.
For more information, Review the help and training article around Exporting backup data.

Developing valuable reports & dashboards
{}Speaker1:{}
Now let’s discuss developing valuable reports and dashboards.
Better insight
Actionable data
Better decisions
Reporting as a monitoring and decision making tool
{}Speaker1:{}
Reporting is a great way to see how you or your company is performing.
However, we recommend you take this a step further and develop a strategic approach to generating actionable data, which can used to make decisions that specifically target performance improvements.
Here’s an example of actionable data:
If you’re company is losing business to competitors, it’s critical to know who, how often, and why.
Track these key data points in salesforce and require your reps to fill out the competitor name and reason lost whenever they lose to a competitor.
You then report on that data to give you the insights you need to adjust your competitive strategy.
If you find out that 70% of your competitive losses involve one specific company, or the primary reason for loss is that they got to the prospect first, you may want dedicate more budget and resources to uncover better leads and develop sales and marketing materials to help your sales representatives be more successful when up against that competitor.
STANDARD REPORTS
CUSTOM REPORTS
Out-of-the-box reports
Can be built from scratch
Stored in standard folders
Can be created from standard reports
Can be customized
Must be saved in a custom, personal, or unfiled folder
Cannot be deleted from the standard report folders
Can be overwritten or deleted
Use Prebuilt Reports
Reports are lists or summaries that allow you to aggregate and analyze your data in different ways.
Reports and Dashboards quickstart
{}Speaker1:{}
Now, let’s talk about some ways to get you up and running with reports and dashboards quickly.
Salesforce provides a rich collection of prebuilt, out of the box standard reports that you can tailor to fit your needs.
Standard reports are available for most objects, including opportunities, accounts, contacts, and administrative reports.
You can start with a standard report, then customize it to fit your requirements and save it as a new report.
These standard reports are always available as a starting point, and they can not be deleted from your standard report folders.
There are many standard reports available so you’ll rarely need to create a brand-new report, especially in the beginning stages of your implementation.
But as you get more comfortable with Salesforce and your reporting requirements evolve, explore some of the custom reporting options.
Benefits include the ability to create the report from scratch, you can start with a standard report and customize as needed, and you can save these reports in a custom, personal, or unfiled folder.
One note of caution.
Custom reports can be overwritten or deleted to those who have access, so make sure users are trained to ‘save as’ modifying a custom report.

Rule of thumb:
In general, if you can see the data, you can report on it.
{}Speaker1:{}
Use our prebuilt dashboards.
Again, we make it easy.
Dashboards are powerful analytic tools, giving you a combined graphical view of data from multiple reports.
To help get you started with them, we have a great dashboard pack available on the AppExchange that contains key dashboards for sales, marketing and support roles, and even for measuring login and adoption in your system.
This is a fast, easy way not only to measure success in your system, but to get dashboards that follow best practices.
Best Practices for Analytics Development
{}Make the data relevant to the audience - {}Think about the audience for the dashboard or report.
{}Group data logically – use space wisely:{}
A well-designed dashboard or report  will ensure that data is displayed in logical groups.
Present only the most important data.
{}Speaker1:{}
Here are some best practices to think of when designing your reports and dashboards:
Dashboards should be designed with the end user in mind.
Know the reason behind the dashboard and what needs are being met.
The physical layout of the dashboard makes a difference.
I tell people to tell a story with a dashboard.
Use the rows and columns logically and use titles and subtitles to help tell the story.
Remember, people read left to right, top to bottom.
The left hand top component occupies a key location on your dashboard, use that to your advantage.
Use footers to support the story, it is where you can put the question being answered by the component.

Demonstration (Optional)
Require a field on a page layout
Create a Validation Rule
Create a formula field
{}Speaker1:{}
{}Demo script – LEX UI:{}
Next I am going to show three simple features that we recommend to help your users input accurate data:
How to set a field as required when creating a salesforce record
How to require a field based upon another value in a record, these are called “Validation Rules”
Finally, how to create a formula field where you expose a field from the account object to a child object, in this case, the opportunity
{}Require a field on a page layout:{}
Now I am going to show you some simple features you can use in your salesforce configuration to ensure accurate quality data entry by your end users.
Our first recommended configuration step is to make sure you set fields to required if they should be entered when a new record is created.
This is a very simple configuration.
Gear Icon > Setup Home > Objects & Fields > Object Manager > Account > Page Layouts > Edit page layout > Edit a field to show how it is made required (explain how this improves data quality but not to go overboard with it)
{}Validation Rules:{}
Next, I want to take you through the process of creating a validation rule.
In this case, I want to make sure that if a sales representative is marking an opportunity as “Closed Lost”, they fill in the custom field we have created for the Closed Lost Reason.
Opportunities Tab > Open existing opportunity.
Show that you cannot make an opportunity Closed Lost unless you have the field “Loss Code” populated with a loss reason.
Gear Icon > Setup Home > Objects & Fields > Object Manager > Opportunity > Validation Rules > Edit rule “Closed Loss Rule“ and explain briefly how it was set up.
{}Formula Field:{}
Finally, let me show you a useful tip on how to display a key field from the Account object down to the child record like the Opportunity without the user having to enter the data in the Opportunity.
-View Opportunity record and show Account Type field
Setup:
- Gear Icon > Setup Home > Objects & Fields > Object Manager > Opportunity > Fields > select New > select a formula field > Type Text field > Next
-Use the advanced formula screen > Insert field, select the Account object with the carrot and then select the Type field.
-Use TEXT Text function to convert the picklist to a text value – here is the formula:
Text(Account.Type )

Select the best way to train your users
{}Speaker1:{}
One of the most important things you and your team can do is establish a training program for your users.
You will need to emphasize the value of training, develop the process you’ll use to deliver training, create your training materials and plans and ensure your management teams support your training program.
Set the stage
Answer “{}What's in it for me?{}”
Tell your users what they can expect from Salesforce and what is expected of them.
Be clear to users how success is measured
Establish “{}If it isn't in Salesforce, it does not exist{}”
{}Speaker1:{}
Your training strategy will include the training objectives and delivery schedule.
It should also include insight into your business objectives and value.
Start with helping your users understand what is expected of them and what they can expect in turn.
{}<animation1>{}Your executive and management teams should drive home the message that “if doesn’t exist in salesforce it doesn’t exist”.
This will help users understand that data quality and completeness is a priority.
{}<animation2>{} Help them understand what metrics are being used by their managers in salesforce to measure success.
{}<animation3>{} And Make sure you sell the value of what users will achieve with salesforce by articulating the “What’s in it for me” for the end user.
If you make it easy for your users to use your solution, establish clear expectations, provide insight into benefits to the business, and explain “what’s in for me” then you have set the stage for success.

<size val="2000">{}Step 1</size><size val="1800"> </size>{}
Identify your audience
{}Speaker1:{}
Here are 3 steps to consider when planning your training:
{}<animation1>{}First, you need to identify your audience
{}<animation2>{}Second, determine relevant user scenarios specific to your audience
{}<animation3>{}And third, define the types of training you will offer, and when and how they will be delivered
Let’s discuss in more detail.
Identify your audience
Who needs to be trained?
What processes are relevant for the audience?
What scenarios are covered by Salesforce?
Key Questions:
Activity Tracking
Reports & Dashboards
Sales Process
Account & Contact Management
{}Training Areas{}
{}Sales Rep{}
{}Sales Manager{}
{}Executive{}
Leads Process
{}Speaker1:{}
Knowing your audience is critical to the success of training.
Different kinds of users will have distinct goals and perform different tasks in Salesforce.
Focus your training based on their role and create training scenarios that are relevant to their day to day.
For example, (1) train your management team separate from your end users, since they will interact with the application in very different ways.
Determine your scenarios
Prep for meeting with prospect – review account, contact and activity history
Capture meeting outputs – update opportunity and set follow-up activities
Use Salesforce1 to capture the information when on the road
<font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}SAMPLE</font><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans Light&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans Light&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{} “{}Day in the Life{}” Sales Rep Scenario:</font>
{}Speaker1:{}
Your training will be more effective if you include scenarios.
These are typical processes your users will go through on a daily basis using Salesforce.
Here is an example of a scenario for a sales representative as they go through their day.
Our sales representative is meeting with a prospective customer.
Your training will show them how to use Salesforce to look up relevant information to prep for the meeting.
Once the meeting ends, it will include steps on how to capture meeting outputs, like updating an open opportunity and scheduling a follow up task.
Also, if the sales rep is on the road, walk through how they can perform the same activities using the Salesforce1 mobile application.

{}Self Paced Training{}
{}In Person Training{}
{}Ad Hoc Meetings{}
{}Speaker1:{}
Here is an example of an ideal training path for your sales representatives.
{}<animation1>{}First, we utilize the basic Getting Started modules from salesforce to familiarize your users with the system and learn the terminology.
These self paced courses can be helpful as pre-requisite training before attending live training.
{}<animation2>{} Next is in-person training where you go through real business processes in your salesforce solution.
Create training in shorter sessions to keep focused on a specific scenario or topic.
If applicable,  h<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;dk1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">ave users enter “real” data not just test data.
Communicate in advance that they should come prepared to training with information they want to enter.</fill-sd>
{}<animation1>{} Finally, do ad hoc follow-up training sessions to provide ongoing training based on feedback provided from your users.
These can be done as brown bags, web-based meetings, emails or in person sessions.

Our salesforce administrators need to develop strategies to make the most use of their time.
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;dk1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Here are some of the top tips to </fill-sd><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;000000&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">m</fill-sd>aximize your admin time and minimize your training time with users.
First, salesforce releases new versions three times a year.
Build time into your training program to review the new release and provide training to your end users as needed for new features you wish to enable.
Second, use Chatter to communicate self serve training materials to your end users
Third, develop a train the trainer program so key users take ownership of training new users within their work groups
Fourth, training should happen throughout the year so build an ongoing training process for new users and for existing users.
And finally, develop a process to track end user training.
This way, you can refer users back to the training plan if they missed a step or have questions.
Salesforce Administrators:
Drive your own career
Salesforce Certification
Get trained and certified
Join a local User Group
Leverage the Success Community to learn from your peers
{}Speaker1:{}
Investing in your administrator is the best way to ensure success.
Here are a few suggestions on how to get educated and stay connected.
{}<animation1>{}  Get trained and certified as a salesforce administrator.
There are a number of self-paced training classes are available within the help and training portal at no additional charge.
A popular course is called “Getting Started:
Administering Salesforce”.
We also offer comprehensive instructor led training courses regionally and virtually at an additional cost.
Afterward, take the exam to earn your salesforce certification.
{}<animation2>{}  Visit our Salesforce University page to learn more about certification.
{}<animation3>{} We also encourage you to join a local user group.
These groups are run by customers who want to network and connect with customers, partners, and administrators in their area.
Look for a local user group near you within the success community.
{}<animation4>{}And join other groups within the Success Community to get connected and learn from salesforce experts.
Support, engage, and motivate your users
{}Speaker1:{}
After users are trained, the next step is to support them, keep them engaged and drive adoption.
The methods you emphasize will naturally depend on your organization’s unique culture.
Let’s talk through some examples.
Drive User Adoption
Executive leadership
Emphasize the value
Motivate by recognition
Develop incentives
{}Motivate{}
{}Support{}
{}Engage{}
Utilize super users
Document your support process and share
Address problems quickly and publicly
Offer refresher training
Develop a communication plan
Create feedback loops
Reach out to resistors
Utilize Chatter
Walk the floor
{}Speaker1:{}
What motivates your users will be unique to your organization but there are common themes we want to share to help drive end user adoption.
{}<animation1>{}
Motivating the team is led by management, and the executive sponsor needs to be engaged throughout the deployment, not just at the beginning.
Keep them involved and communicating the value of using salesforce.
This is a big factor for success.
Continue to articulate the “what’s in it for me” to your users.
As your deployment evolves and you introduce new features or enhancements, each should include the value for the end user.
Some users are very motivated by recognition.
Use adoption dashboards to create a Hall of Fame and highlight users who are actively logging into Salesforce.
Other users are motivated by rewards.
Think about user contests or other ways to provide incentives.
{}<animation2>{}
Once users are live on salesforce, you should develop a support process to provide users a way to get help and ask questions.
Develop and utilize your super users.
These users understand the business processes and are passionate about the value of using salesforce.
Make them an extension of you and a resource to help other users with questions.
Create, document and communicate a support process for your users so they know who to contact and when.
If you have Premier, think about exposing your premier passcode and support number to your users right on the home page and extending that support channel to them.
Level set with your users that is purely for technical help.
Address issues or problems quickly and publically.
Communicate to your users if an issue is discovered, and share when the issue is resolved.
Finally, offer ongoing training and use the frequently asked questions from your support process to identify the topics for training.
We recommend small informal sessions and consider recording and posting them in a shared library based on topic.
{}<animation3>{}
And continue to connect and engage with your users.
Develop and share your ongoing communication plan including upcoming training sessions, milestones, or functional roadmap items you have based on feedback received.
Create a feedback loop so when you receive a suggestion, you have a way to share progress and priority.
We discussed resistors in our first session, who are those users that resist change.
They have great information to share to improve your solution, reach out to them.
We recommended the user of a chatter group to communicate and collect feedback during the launch of salesforce, but utilize this ongoing.
It’s a great way to engage with users within salesforce.
And finally, walk the floor and sit with your users as they are performing their day to day tasks.
Watching go through the motions will help you understand what is working and what is not working.
Best Practice:
Use Chatter to accelerate training and adoption
{}Training{}
Use Groups to consolidate training materials

Reinforce from your executives – provide <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />a forum to champion <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />the implementation
Increase transparency
Celebrate achievements
Showcase super users, MVP’s or early adopters
On-board and mentor employees
{}Speaker1:{}
As we shared earlier, Chatter is a great tool to help deliver training and an environment for engagement
{}<animation1>{}
We recommend using a Chatter to make training easier to deliver and to give users a place to ask questions, participate in conversations and provides an announcement capability to your trainers.
Use Chatter to:
Consolidate training materials
House training schedules and announcements
Connect your users
Provide a space for conversations
Share best practices and how to’s
{}<animation2>{}
Use Chatter as a tool for feedback and user engagement with you and each other
Chatter provides a method for executives to reinforce the value
Chatter provides transparency to crucial information in the application
It allows you to celebrate company, team and individual achievements
And you can also on-board and mentor new employees into your company with Chatter
Creating a Chatter group is an effective way to share important dates and deadlines, provides a central place to store training documents, and allow users to share feedback.
It is the single easiest way to provide a training and feedback environment right in the application for your users.

Track and measure success
{}Speaker2:{}
Part of your implementation plan is how to measure the success of your deployment when you Go Live with your users.
Let’s go into more detail and discuss the tools that will help you.
Best Practice:
Measure Salesforce usage
Adoption Dashboards from the AppExchange
Salesforce usage is a valuable metric for measuring success
{}Success Indicators:{}
Login rates
What data are they creating/updating?
{}Suggestions:{}
Opportunities created, last 30 days
Activities completed, last 30 days
Login rates, last 7 days
Users who haven’t logged in, last 7 days
{}Speaker2:{}
Once users are active on salesforce, usage metrics can provide value and insight into how users are interacting with the system.
Some early indicators of success include login rates and record creation or updates.
Login rates tracks how often users are logging in to salesforce, and record creation or record updates give you insight if users are interacting with the data.
{}<animation1> {}Your success metrics will differ depending on the expected behavior of your users, but here are a few suggested metrics to track:
- How many opportunities have been created in the last 30 days?
- How many activities were completed in the last 30 days?
- What is our login rate over the last 7 days?
- Who is logging in and, more importantly, who is not logging in and why?
Build out your adoption dashboards based on the expected pattern of usage you are aiming for and review these metrics at least once a month.
If you see usage is not progressing like you had hoped, it could be a sign that users need more assistance.
Perhaps additional training is necessary, or some users may need more one on one training if they are struggling.
Remember, you do not need to start from scratch.
Visit the appexchange and download the adoption dashboards which will provide metrics around usage and data creation.
{}<animation2> {}We will include a link to this dashboard in the resource file located below this video.
Best Practice:
Measure data quality
Salesforce Data Quality Dashboards from the AppExchange
Data quality is a valuable metric for measuring adoption
{}Examples:{}
Account Data Quality
Opportunities Data Quality
Missing Account Data
Sales Reps Opportunity Quality Scores
{}Speaker2:{}
Good data quality is another way to measure adoption.
Here are some examples of what you can track and the value of keeping an eye on this data.
During training, you emphasized the need to capture non-required key fields, however the dashboard is showing that a low percentage of those fields are completed.
Are users confused on what to do?
Did they miss the importance of capturing these data fields?
If you have data that is not progressing as expected, such as opportunities stuck in the same sales stage for too long or open deals with a close dates in the past, then users are not maintaining their data which tells you there is a problem.
Are there too many clicks?
Is data hard to find?
Are you unclear on the sales process?
Was there an assumption a process would be followed but there is no mandate to do so?
Having visibility into the data allows you to be proactive to uncover blockers that are impacting adoption.
Use this insight to help users
overcome challenges.
Visit the Appexchange and review the data quality dashboards available.
There are several, including Account and Opportunity data quality.
We will share the link to these dashboards in our resources deck directly below this video.
Best Practice:
Assess User Satisfaction
Survey tools on the AppExchange
User feedback will help you drive adoption
Are your end users finding Salesforce easy to use?
Are Sales Managers managing their teams more effectively?
Are Sales Reps finding content faster?
The appexchange has tools for surveys, check them out!
{}Speaker2:{}
After you have your usage and data quality analysis, the next step is to assess user satisfaction.
This type of measurement is usually done through a survey or formal business process review.
This direct feedback from users can help you understand if the pain points and business objectives are being realized.
This is a fast way for you to get feedback and make adjustments to your Salesforce solution as needed.
For our smaller organizations, you can explore using a Chatter group for feedback and consider creating some chatter polls to get insight.
Be sure to explore the AppExchange to review third party survey tools available.
Track achievement of business outcomes
{}Speaker2:{}
Are you achieving the business outcomes you had targeted?
Here is an example:
For a sales-driven company this may relate to the length of the sales cycle or win rates.
It is up to each individual company to decide which metrics they want to measure and which they are able to measure to understand how salesforce is affecting their business.
Let’s talk about some steps you can take to build these metrics in Salesforce.
What should you do now?
Start the discussion with your stakeholders
Implement the strategy
Build dashboards that highlight your <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;002044&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />key metrics
Start driving performance with actionable <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;002044&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />data and dashboards!
Need a jumpstart?
Use the AppExchange
{}Speaker2:{}
So, where do you start?
If you haven’t already, use the business objectives and key metrics outlined in your Getting started workbook to guide your conversations with your stakeholders.
Schedule a meeting to review and discuss progress.
Implement a strategy around how to track achievements.
Remember, adoption and measurement will evolve over time, but you want to make sure you are tracking progress and taking action on insights to optimize your salesforce deployment.
Start simple but build out some key reports and dashboards and review them with management for feedback.
Make sure the reports and dashboards highlight actionable data so everyone sees the value.
And use the appexchange dashboard packs to get a jump start.

The Getting Started Workbook has worksheets and examples to help you identify your business metrics.
Tailor the worksheet to document what is important to your company.
Outline key questions you want to answer, then associated it with a metric you can track in salesforce.
This gives you an action plan for the metrics you need to create.
Be sure to review the salesforce standard reports as well as the prebuilt dashboards on the AppExchange to help you build them.
Reports and Dashboards available on the AppExchange
100+ more reports and dashboards from partners to explore as you expand and grow your business.
Salesforce CRM Dashboards
Sales Activity Dashboards
Service and Support Dashboards
Salesforce Mobile Dashboard for iPad
{}Speaker2:{}
We’ve introduced the Adoption and Data quality dashboards available on the appexchange, but there are more.
These best practice dashboards were built by salesforce experts to help customers get visibility into common metrics tracked across our customer base.
Examples include
Salesforce CRM Dashboards, which includes Sales, Service, and Marketing dashboards
Sales Activity Dashboards
and mobile dashboards for your Ipad
Let’s share some best practices as you consider downloading these AppExchange dashboard packs:
You have the option to install the dashboard in your sandbox environment or in a developer org.
This will let you explore prior to installing in your production instance.
You have full control to customize these dashboards and the underlying reports to meet your business needs.
You can even delete if they do not fit your needs.
And finally, once the dashboards are ready, communicate the availability to your stakeholders for their review and feedback.
You may consider informal training sessions so people know how to use them.
Validate your solution
Ensure user adoption by testing their experience.
Is your training preparing your users?
Does your feedback process create engagement and trust?
Do your users feel supported?
Are you measuring the right <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />business outcomes?
{}Speaker2:{}
Throughout our Getting started series, we’ve recommended that you validate your design and customizations with end users.
Continue this best practice to validate your training, support and engagement processes with end users as well.
Are you meeting your user’s needs?
Do they feel supported?
In addition, you will want to validate that the business dashboards you created meet their needs as well.
Make sure you do this validation and testing to drive a successful rollout.

{}Social Studio & Radian6{}
{}KEY TAKEAWAY:{}
Social Studio and Radian6 are built on the same platform = {}Your login details work for both!{}
URL:
<lnk-c val="&lt;a:hlinkClick r:id=&quot;rId4&quot;/&gt;">Socialstudio.radian6.com</lnk-c>
Use for:
Publishing content – Add icons
Engaging with posts from social accounts
Social listening/ Analyzing results
URL: <lnk-c val="&lt;a:hlinkClick r:id=&quot;rId5&quot;/&gt;">login.radian6.com</lnk-c>
Use for:
Deep dive analysis for social listening
{}Explain the connection between Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Social Studio and Radian6{}
{}Speaker1:{}
<size val="1200"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}Understanding the connection between Social Studio and Radian6 is also important.{}
</font></size>Social Studio and Radian6 are two separate interfaces but are built on the same platform.
<size val="1200"> <font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{} {}This means that if you create a topic profile within the Radian6 application, it will be available in Social Studio and vice versa.
As well, all users you add in Social Studio will also be available in Radian6.
The difference is that the Social Studio interface is the one-stop shop for all things Marketing Cloud Social.
It is here where you can create and collaborate on content with your team and then publish it to your social accounts.
You can also engage with posts on your social accounts, and listen and analyze conversations that are happening around your brand.
For most users, this is all you will need. </font></size>
If, however, you need to conduct a deep dive analysis on your topic profiles you may want to use the Radian6 analysis dashboard.
It is currently slightly more customizable than Social Studio.
For the purpose of this webinar series we are going to focus on Social Studio.

{}Social Studio:{}
{}Log In{}
{}Explain the connection between Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Social Studio and Radian6{}
{}Speaker1:{}
{}There are two ways to log into Social Studio and the way you choose will depend on which Marketing Cloud products you have access to.{}
{}If you have just purchased MC social Studio, you will log in via socialstudio.radian6.com.{}
{}If you have access to the Marketing Cloud (which includes email, journey builder, etc), you can log in through that application as well.{}
10
{}Workspaces{}
Before you can really get the most out of  Social Studio you need to understand two basic concepts, workspaces and User Roles.
11
{}Social Studio:{}
{}Workspaces{}
{}KEY TAKEAWAY:{}
Social Studio and Radian6 are built on same platform = {}Your login details work for both!{}
Workspaces:
Key to organizing your teams and{} the social accounts they work on.
- Only {}Full Users {}and {}Super Users {}can create workspaces
<size val="1200"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}Workspaces are the key to organizing your teams and the social accounts they work on.{}
{}They are the </font></size><size val="2200"><eff-l val="&lt;a:effectLst/&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-lt&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}core component of Social Studio.
In a workspace, you will be able to:</font></eff-l></size>
1) View a calendar of posts from that workspace’s social accounts
2) Compose, schedule, and publish content for that workspace’s social accounts
3) Compose drafts for later use
4) View performance for the workspace’s social accounts
5) Add notes to communicate with other members who have access to the workspace
6) Use approval rules to preview and approve content before it goes live
7) Engage with posts made to that workspace’s social accounts or brought in by a social media search
<size val="1200"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">Workspaces are associated with specific social accounts.
For example, if your company offers a rewards program, and has a twitter account and facebook page associated with that program, you could create a Rewards workspace and only bring in those accounts.
</font></size>You might also have Twitter and Facebook customer support social accounts<size val="1200"> .<font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">You could then create a workspace just to handle customer support issues and ensure the right users have access.
There are countless ways to organize your workspaces, you just need to think about what works best for your company.</font></size>
12
{}Adding A Social Channel{}
{}Once you have determined the Workspaces you will need, you will need to add social channels to those workspaces.{}
{}Adding Social Channels to your Social Studio account is easy!{}
In the Workspace page, you will click on the Gear icon where you want the new social channel added.
Once you have navigated to the + Add New option – which I will show in the upcoming demo – you will complete the necessary steps to add your channel.
Channels available to add to your Social Studio account are Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+,  YouTube, and Instagram.
The screen shots above show the screens you would see if you were adding Facebook to your account.
13
{}User Roles{}
After you determine what workspaces you will need, you need to think about who will have access to those workspaces, and what their roles should be.
14
{}Social Studio:{}
{}Organization User Roles{}
{}Social studio uses a User Role based permission set.{}
There are three types of user roles that impact what users can access, add, or update in the organization:
This graph depicts the level of access each user role has.
The three levels are 1) Super Users, 2) Full Users and 3) Basic Users.
<size val="2200"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-lt&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">A Super User has full create, view, edit and disable/delete permissions on all areas of the Social Studio organization.</font></size>
<size val="1200"> As you can see, they can also:</size>
<size val="1200"> 1) </size><size val="2200"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-lt&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">Manage users and user settings, assign users to workspaces, and force password resets</font></size>
2) Edit and view all workspaces
3) Edit and delete all macros
4) Edit all user records
<size val="2200"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-lt&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;"> 5) Add social accounts</font></size><size val="1200"> </size>
<size val="2200">A Full User is the default user level for new users.
Full Users can create most types of resources, and can edit and delete the content they own</size><size val="1200">.
They can create and edit their own macros, and view the content of of workspaces they are members of.</size>
A Basic User can view other users in the organization, but can only change their own personal information.
Basic users also have the following abilities:
1) View content in workspaces they are a member of
2) View and edit any posts they have created
<size val="2200"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-lt&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">Basic Users cannot change any of the organization’s settings.</font></size><size val="1200"> </size>
If you are the primary user or admin of your Social Studio account, you will want to be set up as a Super User..
As you can see, Super users have full reign, while basic users have limited access.
If you are a super user it’ll be your job to set up the workspaces and assign users to those workspaces.
15
{}Social Studio:{}
{}Workspace Permissions{}
Users can be added to workspaces.
Permissions in workspaces are separate from the organization user role.
You can set the amount of access each user has within a workspace by using Workspace permissions.
The levels are:
{}Admin{}:
An Admin of a workspace can manage users, social accounts, permissions, settings, labels and publish content in all accounts in the workspace.
{}Contributor{}:
This member can publish and engage with social accounts in the workspace.
They cannot manage workspace settings, add users, or add social accounts, but they can modify user settings.
{}Limited member{}:
This member can view content in the workspace (including the calendar and performance) but cannot publish to the social accounts.
However, you can edit their user permissions to enable them to engage or publish from some or all of the social accounts in the workspace.
{}{}It’s important to remember that:{}{}
{}{}The same social account can be added to more than one workspace{}{}
{}{}Users can be members of  more than one workspace{}{}
{}{}Workspace members can have different permissions in different workspaces{}{}
To set workspace roles simply click on the workspace name, click the cog setting, and then select Users.
From here you can add users to the workspace, set their workspace role and delete users from the workspace.
16
{}Social Studio:{}
{}User Avatars{}
Personalize your representation in Social Studio
Help colleagues put a face to a name with User Avatars.
You can:
Easily upload and switch out images, or keep the default
See your chosen image as a permanent menu fixture
Help colleagues quickly recognize one another within the user list
Notes
Does not support animated gifs or advanced image editing
Super users cannot upload images on behalf of other users
Once users are added they can now create their own avatars.
Avatars can be uploaded to in My Settings.
This feature allows colleagues to easily identify each other within the user list.
17
{}Live Demonstration{}
Navigate admin settings
Add new users
Add new social account
Create a workspace
{}Speaker1:{}
{}So now that we’ve talked through the basic set up of Social Studio and how to access it, let’s log into the app.{}
{}{}Welcome Screen:{}{}
{}Once you log in the first screen you’ll see is the wizard to help you create a workspace.{}
This screen may vary depending on your user role.
For example, Super users will be able to create  a new workspace, For a basic user, this button would be greyed out.
You’ll also notice two buttons along the top.
One is for workspaces, which we’re currently in, the other is Performance.
This is where you come to run cross-workspace reports.
{}Up in the right hand corner you will notice your name{}.
{}This is where you come to check personal and organizational settings.{}
Here, you will also be able to see what tenant you are logged into and your User Role.
If you click on My Settings you can change your password, or change your email address.
You can also change your language preference.
To check organizational settings, reclick your name.
Then click the Admin cog.
In here, again depending on your user role, you will have access to add new social accounts, create macros, add and manage users and manage the organizational settings such as your time zone.
{}Let’s add a new user.{}
Staying within the Admin settings you will see a section called users.
We’re going to click on “Add new”.
Fill in the new users display name, which will be the name that shows up within the application, User name, which is what they will need to log in, and their email.
The language and time zone will autopopulate based on the organizational settings you have already configured.
However, if these settings do not work for the user, simply choose the correct values from the drop down menus.
You will then select  their role from either Super User, Full User or Basic.
Set the user as Active so they now have access to Social Studio.
Or if you need to deactivate a user, you would select Deactivate.
The final step is selecting which workspaces the user will have access to.
Simply click “Add to Workspace”  and select from the list of available workspaces.
{}Next let’s add a social account{}.
Note, in order to add a social account you must be the page admin of that account.
You will need to authorize Social Studio to have access to the account.
{}Now we’re ready to create a workspace{}.
So lets return to the workspace screen by clicking the Social Studio logo.
We’re going to click “Create New”.
Now we’re going to name our workspace.
Remember to name it something that reflects the product or function you will be working on.
Let’s name ours _____.
You can also upload a picture and provide a description of the workspace.
Once you’ve chosen a name click “Next”.
You will now be prompted to add the social accounts you want in this workspace.
Simply search for the name and click on it.
The social account will appear on the right.
Once all accounts are added click Next.
You will then be prompted to add workspace members.
These will be the individuals who will need to have access to this particular workspace.
You can change the user’s permissions and access once added.
To delete a user, simply click the X next to their name.
Once you’ve added all the users you will be taken to a summary screen.
Here you can check to ensure everything is set up they way you want it.
If everything looks good, click Finish.
And now you have your first workspace.
Once you click finish you will be directed to the publish calendar (if you have publish) or the Engage tab if you do not have Publish.
In this view you can see the name of the workspace in the top left.
You can return to the welcome screen by clicking ______.
You can also navigate between Publish, Engage and Analyze by clicking on the names along the top.
To access Workspace Settings, simply click the Cog next to the workspace name.
Within this area you can manage any settings that pertain to that particular workspace.
From this view you can also set up approval rules and labels for outgoing content.
You may want to use approval rules if you require content to be reviewed and approved prior to posting.
As well, you may want to label your content a specific way for easier tracking.

{}You can now create a topic profile within Analyze.{}
A topic profile is a collection of keywords or phrases that you define.
These keywords can be grouped into categories such as Brand, competitors and Industry or they may be left uncategorized.

It’s important to note that there are some features - such as source filters-  currently only available in Radian6.

{}Dashboard Types{}
Twitter Account Summary
Facebook Account Summary
Social Listening Summary
LinkedIn Account Summary
Google + Account Summary
YouTube Account Summary
{}Explain the connection between Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Social Studio and Radian6{}
{}Speaker1:{}
There are six types of dashboards you can create:
1) Twitter Account Summary  2) Social Listening Summary, 3) Facebook Account Summary  4) LinkedIn Account Summary 5) Google+ Account Summary and 6) YouTube Account Summary.
Each summary dashboard provides overviews of volume, sentiment trends and emerging keywords.
Some differences do occur between the dashboards based on where the information is coming from.
For example, the emerging key words from  the twitter account summary dashboard are pulled from up to 50 twitter accounts, where the emerging keywords from a Social Listening summary account dashboard are from a social listening topic profile.
Key Note:
Up to 10 Google+ accounts can be used to create a dashboard
22
{}Start with the basics:{}
{}Dashboard Cards{}
{}Speaker1:{}
There are 6 different types of cards that display summary data.
Engagement Summary Card
Engagement Trend Card
Feed Card
Sentiment Summary Card
Sentiment Trend Card
Conversation Cloud Card
Let’s review each in detail.
23
{}Start with the basics:{}
{}Dashboard Cards – <size val="2400">Engagement Summary </size>{}
Twitter Account Summary
Social Listening Summary
{}Explain the connection between Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Social Studio and Radian6{}
{}Speaker1:{}
The Engagement Summary card shows the overall engagement (volume) and breakdown of post volume by interactions or media type.
The data displayed varies depending on the type of dashboard.
For example:
For a Twitter Account Summary, the card will display:
Overall volume of your twitter account(s)
Post count
And the percentages and daily averages for tweets, mentions(including retweets, @mentions, and replies) and direct messages sent and received.
For  a Social Listening Summary, the card will display:
Overall volume of your topic profile  and post count
And the percentages and daily averages for various media types including twitter, facebook, blogs, mainstream news, forum, forum replies, aggregator, buy/sell
Note:
There will be subtle differences for each of the four dashboard types, this is just an example of two.
24
{}Start with the basics:{}
{}Dashboard Cards – <size val="2400">Engagement Trend </size>{}
Twitter Account Summary
Social Listening Summary
{}Speaker1:{}
{}The Engagement Trend card shows overall  engagement (volume) trended over a time period by interactions or posts in popular media types.{}
You can toggle the media types to either show or hide them by checking the box in the legend.
Also if you hover your mouse over a specific data point it will show you the value and the date.
25
{}Start with the basics:{}
{}Dashboard Cards – <size val="2400">Feed Card</size>{}
{}Speaker1:{}
{}The feed card shows all posts for the given time period.{}
If you click on the post, the post inspector will pop open.
The feed card may also show different post features such as workflow status, post tags, and whether the post has been sent to Salesforce.
26
{}Start with the basics:{}
{}Dashboard Cards – <size val="2400">Sentiment Summary Card</size>{}
{}Speaker1:{}
{}The sentiment summary card shows the average sentiment and the breakdown of sentiment by type{}:
Postiive, somewhat positive, neutral, somewhat negative and negative.
The legend is interactive so you can show or hide the various sentiment types.
And if you hover over sections of the pie, it will show you the number of posts within that sentiment typ{}e.{}
27
{}Start with the basics:{}
{}Dashboard Cards – <size val="2400">Sentiment Trend Card</size>{}
{}Speaker1:{}
{}The sentiment trend card shows a view of sentiment type percentage per day over a period of time.{}
Again, there is an interactive legend that lets you hide or show each sentiment type as needed, and you can see the number of posts that make up the percentage by hovering over the sentiment type.
28
{}Start with the basics:{}
{}Dashboard Cards – <size val="2400">Conversation Cloud Card</size>{}
{}Speaker1:{}
{}The final card type is the conversation cloud.{}
This card displays the top 50 key words in alphabetical order from the last 1000 posts.
The size of the word represents the relative volume of usage, so the bigger the word the more it was used.
29
{}Analyze- Actionable Insights{}
See a post and want to respond?
No need to leave Analyze!
Facebook –Reply and Like posts right from your Facebook dashboards
Twitter- Reply, Retweet, Quote and Direct Message from your Twitter or Social Listening dashboards

{}Speaker1:{}
{}Alright, so now that we know the basic set up of Analyze, let’s log into the app to see it in action.{}
{}{}Welcome Screen:{}{}
{}When you log in the first screen you will see is the workspace calendar view.{}
{}Check to ensure you are in the correct workspace.{}
{}Navigate to Analyze.{}
{}As we mentioned, you will be taken to a clear screen and prompted to create a dashboard.{}
So here is where you choose what type of dashboard you would like to create either a Twitter Summary dashboard or a Social Listening Summary dashboard.
Let’s begin by creating a dashboard based on our Twitter social account.
When you click on Twitter Account Summary you will see all the twitter social accounts available within the workspace.
Choose the one you want to analyze.
A dashboard will populate with an analysis of all the data from the social account you chose.
You will see the 6 cards we discussed previously that are autopopulated with the results.
You can easily drill down and filter the data from here.
For example, to filter the data in the “posts over time” card you can simply check which boxes you want to see and uncheck those you don’t want to see.
The same goes for sentiment and sentiment over time.
Simply check or uncheck the data to get the view you want to see.
For posts shown in the feed, you can use Post Inspector to view any workflow or labels that have been applied to the post.
And drill down further.
You can now also add workflow to the posts from this view.
You can also use analyze to bring in data from a topic profile you have created.
As I mentioned earlier, topic profiles can be created either within social studio or within the Radian6 app.
Topic profiles created in Radian6 are available within Social Studio and vice versa.
Because this webinar series focuses on Social Studio, I’ll demonstrate how to create a topic profile from within analyze.
Click on the Admin setting cog.
From there we add a new topic profile.
It’ll prompt us to identify our key words.
We can set proximity to those key words.
We can also filter by language, media type or region.
Simply click, create new topic profile and its done.
Now that you have created your Topic Profile and added it to your workspace, you can create a Social Listening Dashboard.
Let’s go back to Analyze, and click create New Dashboard.
This time we are going to select Social Listening Dashboard.
Note the EMV on the topic profile (since you may have a limit based on your entitlement).
Choose the topic profile you want and the dashboard will populate.
You’ll notice the card names are all the same, but the data coming in is slightly different.
For example, the data in the Post Volume card will show the % of posts from Facebook, Twitter, and other media sources instead of “tweets”, DMs etc.
I{}f you create more than one dashboard you can simply go back and forth by using the dropdown menu at the top of the screen.{}
This is similar to the workspace menu  where you can choose from recent dashboards you have created or select the Dashboard Gallery, which is like the welcome screen for workspaces, but will show you all dashboards.
To delete a dashboard simply click on the Cog on the upper right while you are viewing the dashboard.
From the drop down menu choose, Delete dashboard.

What do we mean by Publish?
Publish is the name of our Social Content Marketing product.
You can use Publish for collaborative team planning on a unified calendar, protect your company’s brand by customizing approval rules for social content, and find relevant, trendy and compelling content by accessing sources via our open platform and ecosystem of partner apps.
Let’s first review the basic layout of Publish and its key features  and then I’ll demonstrate how to set it up.
{}Start with the basics:{}
{}Publish{}
{}Social Studio Publish is one of the three key functionalities of Social Studio.{}
{}The other two being Listen and Analyze, and Engage.{}
{}It’s important to note that not everyone has access to Publish as it is purchased separately from those other two.{}
{}The primary purpose of Publish is to help companies coordinate the launch of their social media content across teams and social accounts.{}
{}When you log into Social Studio you will be taken to the publish calendar view of the last workspace you were in.{}
{}This view will show you (1) a view of all pending content launches across multiple social accounts within the workspace.{}
{}Date ranges and calendar view settings are found on the top right corner (2/3).{}
{}Calendar filters including social accounts and approval status can be found on the left.{}
{}On the far left you’ll also find the icons to create content, check performance of a social account, review drafts and view content that has recently been shared.{}

{}Creating Content{}
{}Facebook Gating:{}
Useful for companies with one Global Facebook page.
{}Feed Targeting:{}
Helps with targeting and improves engagement
{}LinkedIn Targeting:{}
Target your audience by industry, function, seniority, {}and/or geography
{}Twitter:{}
Target your whole audience to maximize {}awareness
{}YouTube and Google +:{}
Track performance including views, {}comments, link clicks, likes and dislikes
{}Instagram:{}
Track likes and comments for the {}visualization of your brand
Within Publish there are currently five types of posts you can create:
Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, Youtube, Google+, and Instagram. In.
Each type of post provides a different ability to  target and engage your intended audience.
It is important to note, that to publish to Instagram you must your our Social Studio mobile app because Instagram doesn’t provide API access to allow partners, like ourselves, to publish to their network.
<font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">For example:
Facebook provides two targeting options:
Facebook gating or Feed targeting.
Gating is a great option if you have one global Facebook page for your company.
</font>Gating a post makes it viewable to users within specific countries or who speak specific languages.
Once published, a gated post will only appear in the newsfeed and on the page to users within the chosen demographic.
<font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">Feed targeting is a little different.
This is a great option to use if you want the content to live on your facebook page and viewable to all users, but you only want to send the content to a specific demographic.
By t</font>argeting posts to match various marketing segments you can greatly improve a post’s engagement.
LinkedIn Targeting lets you target a LinkedIn Post's audience by company size, industry, function, seniority and/or geography.
This is a great feature to use if you are recruiting talent for your company and only want to target users within a particular function, such as marketing.
With Twitter posts the content is available and shareable by all.
It is a great way to maximize the exposure of your content.
11
{}Repost and Cross-Post Efficiently{}
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;009DDC&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Duplicate Posts:
</fill-sd><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;7C868D&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">It’s important to publish great content regularly and the easiest way to do that is to use the “Duplicate” option to post to the same network or cross-post and optimize it for another network. </fill-sd>
Duplicating posts is a great time saver in your busy day.
You can re-use textual posts across networks, and in the case of video posts, you can upload the video once and share it to another network without uploading it again.
I will show how you do this in our demo.
If you duplicate a Facebook post, all of the metadata like gating, targeting, and labeling is maintained and used for the subsequent post.
If you are duplicating a YouTube post for Facebook, you can add gating and targeting criteria to optimize your Facebook post.
{}Collaboration{}
The product also provides an excellent solution for teams to collaborate on posts.
{}Calendar{}
The Publish calendar is the obvious tool to use for collaboration amongst teams.
The calendar allows you to see when content is scheduled to go live for each social account that is added to that particular workspace.
You can filter the calendar a variety of ways including, by date, post status, and social accounts.
Quick tip to share:
Typically we recommend to segment your social accounts and teams into different workspaces to help keep things  organized, however, there is a use case for creating a workspace that houses all your social accounts.
Some companies do this so that they can see the schedule for all content across all workspaces.
Typically, content is not created in this workspace, but it does allow an all encompassing calendar view of all scheduled and draft form content.
Some other key collaboration features I’d suggest you take advantage of are the notes feature and shared content.
{}Notes{}
<font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">The notes feature allows any team member to provide a quick update on the post.
You can access notes by clicking on any calendar date. (click 1) The note is housed in the post inspector window that pops up (click 2, 3).
Leave </font><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-lt&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">n</font>otes for team members in your Workspace to view, edit, or remove Posts.
Notes can be up to 256 characters in length and be used to document anything such as:
-Notes to other team members
-Questions
-Comments
-Suggestions
You can also see who the note is from and respond directly in the post inspector.
13
{}Collaboration{}
Shared Content
{}Shared Content{}
<font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">Shared content is the ultimate tool for collaboration and promoting team success.
</font>Shared Content are posts and content that are saved in a special folder within Social Studio so they can be reused and shared among other members in a workspace.
Using Shared Content is important in that it allows users to reuse and modify previous created top performing content without having to recreate it from scratch every time, possibly introducing errors or inconsistencies in style, info and voice.
If a post needs to be reused, shared content can be created from a published, unpublished, scheduled or unscheduled posts.
14
{}Performance and Tracking{}
The final key feature I want to highlight is the ability to track the performance of your content.
Once your content is posted, the post's performance can be measured and tracked to analyze the effectiveness and if the post is accomplishing the targets or milestones you may have established.
Content Performance can be measured and tracked in different locations within Social Studio:
1) Individual post level
2) Workspace content performance, which reports on content performance for a workspace
3) Cross workspace performance, which reports on content performance for all the workspaces in the organization
If you want to see how well your posted content is performing at an individual level,  you can simply click on the post and the stats will be available in the post inspector window.
Here you can view overall totals and breakdown of reach, clicks, engagements and engagement rate.
As well you can see the breakdown of negative feedback.

Review filtering options
Add a note
Create and edit a post
Publish a post
{}Now let’s move into the app to show you how Publish works!{}
{}The picture here shows the end state of some published content.{}
{}Let’s go into the app and demo out the steps.{}
{}{}Welcome Screen:{}{}
{}When you log in the first screen you will see is the workspace calendar view.{}
This will be the calendar of the last workspace you were in.
Make sure to check that you are in the correct workspace.
You can check what workspace your in by looking at the name beside the Social Studio logo.
To switch to another workspace, simply click on the arrow beside the current workspace name.
The drop down menu will show you a list of your recent workspaces, and also give you the option to return to the main workspace menu.
In this drop down menu you can also access workspace settings by clicking on the Cog.
{}So let’s go back to the calendar view and I’ll show you how to adjust the date settings.{}
The calendar can easily be changed to  show a view for a day, week or month. (demonstrate).
{}You can further filter the content you’re viewing by clicking the “Filter” button.{}
This will allow you to filter by Social Account, content status or content labels, authors or  media type.
For example, if I just wanted to see content being posted to my facebook social account, I would only select that social account.
If I only wanted to see content being created by me, I would go down to the area titles “Match any of these authors” and select only myself.
You could also filter it to only view content that is published or only see content that is currently scheduled. (demonstrate).
{}You can also add notes within the calendar.{}
Simply click on the date you want to add a note to and you will see the option show up.
{}So now let’s learn how to actually create a post within Publish.{}
Along the left hand side you’ll notice the 6 “action” buttons we reviewed previously.
To create content, we’re going to click on the bright green one.
Lets create a post in Twitter.
From here  we’re able to select which account the content will be posted to, we can create our content and upload a picture if we want.
We can click the button “get content from apps” if we want to upload a stock photo or use Trendspottr to see what is currently trending online.
Note, you will need to have an account with these apps in order to use them..
We can choose whether we want to publish this post immediately or choose a later date.
Also, we have the option of shortening the link if we want.
And, we can apply a label which can be useful for filtering and reporting.
Once all the fields are filled out you can either save the post as a draft, or you can publish.
When you go back to the calendar view you will see your post on the date you selected.
Let’s try another example but this time let’s create content for LinkedIn.
We’ll follow the same steps except this time we’re going to add a target.
This means we can select who we want to view the content.
The target group can be based on geolocation, job function, industry, company size and seniority.
So for our example let’s target people on linkedin from the Greater Boston Area.
We’re going to publish and now when we go to the calendar view, we can see our post is ready to go.
And my boss and the other co-workers who have access to this workspace can see what’s planned to be released this month.
{}Now, once a post is created, you may need to edit it.{}
For example, maybe the sale you were going to promote has moved to another date or been cancelled all together.
To edit a post, simply click on the post you want to edit in the calendar view.
The post inspector window will appear.
About half way down you will see “Edit”.
Click on it.
This will take you to the “create content view”.
Simply edit the changes you want to make and click save.
To view any draft posts click on the draft icon on the left, then select the post you want to edit.
This will bring you to the “Create content” screen and you can alter the post and schedule it from here.
Alright, so now that we’ve created a post and published it, we’ll want to keep track of it’s performance.
This can be done one of two ways.
If you just want a quick view of stats for an individual post you can simply click on the post in the calendar.
This will cause a window to appear on the right.
Scroll down and you’ll see a performance summary for that post.
If you want to pull a report on all posts, click the performance icon on the left.
This will provide you with an overall view of performance by social account.
If you want to export the data you can click a Post Report.
This can show all posts, or posts separated by the available social accounts.
We’re going to export the performance of all posts.
So, I will click on “All Posts”, which takes me to a table view showing the stats for each post that has been made on the workspace.
By clicking “Filters” we can choose the date range we want to see.
So I’ll select all posts from the last 2 weeks.
I’ll then click export to a .csv file.
Then I’ll have the data to analyze in excel.
{}The next area we’ll quickly review is Tasks.{}
If you have actions related to approval rules, they will be displayed here.
Now, you may not have approval rules set up in your tenant, and that’s ok.
However, if you do, when they are triggered, the posts will show up here while they wait for approval.
Approval rules can be found in the workspace settings. (demonstrate how to get there).
So, if you are the approver, you can go to tasks to see which posts you need to approve.
Let’s reject this one. (demonstrate).
<size val="1200"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}The final left hand option is Shared Content.{}
Sharing content that has performed successfully, such as a post that gets a lot of engagement, amongst </font></size><size val="2200"><eff-l val="&lt;a:effectLst/&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-lt&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">other teams can be quite valuable.
By sharing the content with other workspace, those teams can then simply edit as they require and hope to get similar results.
When you click on the shared content icon, you will be able to view all shared content and which workspaces it has been shared with (demonstrate).
You can also see the content stats such as how many times it has been used, total engagements, average engagements and the overall engagement rates.
So let’s decide to use this content.
We are then taken to the edit content screen and we can change or schedule as we wish.</font></eff-l></size>

{}Objective Slide{}
{}Speaker1:{}
During this webinar we are going to touch on a variety of topics including how to create columns and tabs specific to your business needs.
We will introduce you to Post Inspector, teach you how to create macros, and how to access your topic profiles from Analyze so you can respond to posts about your brand appropriately,
{}Let’s Get Started{}
8
{}Start with the basics:{}
{}Engage{}
{}Navigating Engage{}
{}Speaker1:{}
{}Engage is one of the three functions available in Marketing Cloud Social Studio.{}
{}It is here where you will be able respond to posts about your brand or apply workflow to ensure they are dealt with or at least labeled appropriately.{}
{}Let’s review Engage’s interface.{}
{}To get to the Engage interface simply click on the workspace you want to be in.{}
{}You will automatically be brought to the calendar view of the workspace.{}
{}From there simply click Engage (1) from them top banner.{}
{}If it is your first time using Engage in the workspace you will be prompted to add a column.{}
{}Columns (2) can be comprised of any of your social accounts or even topic profiles you have created in Analyze.{}
{}As a reminder, Topic Profiles are social media searches of content that might not show up in your standard social accounts.{}
{}To add a column simply click (3) the “Add Column” icon.{}
{}This is prompt you to select a topic profile or social account you have already created.{}
{}Within each column you will see each post (4) being brought in about that specific topic.{}
{}If you click on a post, the Post Inspector screen will appear (5).{}
{}Post inspector allows you to apply an action or workflow to the post.{}
{}Here you can take actions such as responding, reposting, or direct messaging the sender.{}
{}You can also  label the post to make for easier reporting, apply sentiment and use workflow to ensure the right person responds.{}
{}You can also apply a macro to the post from the Post Inspector panel.{}
{}We will discuss Macros in more detail once we move into the app.{}
{}Along the bottom of the screen you will see “My tab” (6).{}
{}Tabs are used to organize your columns in to specific categories.{}
{}For example, one tab may contain columns from your Facebook social accounts and another tab may have columns with conversations from your Twitter social accounts.{}
{}You can simply add a tab by clicking the “+” icon.{}
{}Once clicked, you can name the tab whatever you’d like.{}
9
{}Understanding Columns{}
{}Navigating Engage{}
{}Speaker1:{}
Let’s take a minute to understand the different types of columns you can have, where the information comes from, and how they are beneficial.
With Engage you can pull in activity from your Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn social accounts {}(click 1{}).
Remember, in order to have access to these accounts they need to be added first to your organization settings and then added to the appropriate workspace.
You can add social accounts to a workspace within the workspace settings. ({}click 2){}.
By pulling in data from your social accounts you are able to engage and respond to posts and comments directed at your company.
Topic profiles can also be pulled into an Engage Column.
Quick reminder, Topic profiles are customized searches based on a set of keywords that you define.
The key difference between Topic Profile columns and Social account columns is that the information being pulled into the Topic Profiles are based on the defined keywords and the comments that are pulled in may not be directed specifically at your company.
This allows you to comment and engage with posts that would not normally be pulled into your social accounts.
As well, you an have a mixture of social media types pulled into a topic profile.
There are many use cases for using topic profiles but some examples include:
1) identifying potential leads, 2) recruiting talent and 3) proactive customer service.
If you remember from the Listen and Analyze webinar, there are two places where you can create topic profiles 1) organizational settings and workspace settings {}(click 3)){}.
Topic Profiles created in Organizational settings will need to be imported into the desired workspace before they are available to use in that workspace.
You can import a topic profile within the workspace settings cog.
10
{}Collaboration, Workflow, and Macros{}
{}Workflow and Macros:{}
Engaging with a post is essentially performing an action to the post by replying, retweeting, deleting, etc.
Workflow management refers to the prescribed actions you assign to social media posts.
For example: assigning posts with a specific hashtag to a specific person in your organization.
The post can be engaged from either the Engage column or from within the Post Inspector. (click 1) Here you choose to reply, retweet, DM (Click 2) change the status of the post.
(Click 3) Set the post priority (Click 4) and Assign it to the appropriate resource. (click 5).
A new feature recently added is real-time collaboration.
This feature provides real-time updates to show when co-workers inspect posts for engagement allowing teams to know who is online and what posts they’re working on {}(click 6){}.
Part of this feature includes automated column updates where columns detect and automatically remove posts that no longer match your filter settings.
Macros enable more efficient workflow by using one Macro button to apply a variety of custom actions to multiple posts at the same time.(Click 6) Macros save time and provides a more uniform approach to how a team engages with posts.
(For Twitter and Facebook).
Engagement Macros can be created by either a Super User or by a Full User from the Organization Admin section (with the <lnk-c val="&lt;a:hlinkClick r:id=&quot;rId3&quot;/&gt;">proper Permission levels</lnk-c>).
Full Users can only create and edit their own macros and Super Users can create and edit any macro.
Engage Macros can be used to automate and streamline various actions such as:
Assigning multiple post entries with a certain hashtag to a certain person AND changing the status to "Reviewed, determining best response" AND setting the priority to High AND assigning a specific post label AND changing the classification to "Customer Lead”.
Note:
Publishing macros and Engage macros are different and cannot be used interchangablely.

{}So, let’s jump into the app to see how we can use the Engage feature.{}
{}{}Welcome Screen:{}{}
{}Check to ensure you are in the correct workspace.{}
<size val="1200"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}Navigate to Engage by clicking on the Engage tab up top (</font></size><size val="2200"><eff-l val="&lt;a:effectLst/&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-lt&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}Show initial blank starting view).
You can configure tabs of columns to create a view that works for you.
The view is private to you and you can create unlimited tabs and columns.
Important note:
Check the workspace you are in.
You’ll automatically be returned to the workspace you were last in To navigate to other workspaces simply click on the Workspace name in the top left hand corner next to the Social Studio logo.
The name displayed is the workspace you are currently in.
Once clicked, you can see a list of recent workspaces you have worked on.
You can also click on “All workspaces” to be taken back to the workspace view.
As well, you can create a new workspace directly from here.</font></eff-l></size>
{}Next we’re going to create a Tab:{}
As I mentioned earlier tabs are a great way to organize your social accounts.
For the purpose of this webinar we are going to create a tab for Facebook and a tab for Twitter.
To rename a tab, just click on the arrow beside the tab and you’ll be prompted to either rename or delete the tab.
To add a new tab Simply click on the (+) sign.
You can name your new tab, then click “Add Tab”.
Tabs can be dragged and dropped to customize your desktop and prioritize the most important discussions.
{}Once you have your tab created you’re going to need to create columns.{}
Click the Add column icon.
This will prompt you to choose either a social account or a topic profile you have created.
Because I’m in my facebook tab,  I’m going to add a Facebook social account.
So you can see all the posts on my social account are now displayed in the column.
But what if I want to segment the posts from those that I’ve posted versus those that my customers/ followers have posted.
This may be important to know if I want to take action on any negative posts coming in about my brand or to reply to  customer service issues.
You can segment the data by using filters
{}To apply a filter to a column click the settings cog on the top right of the column.{}
This will cause a screen to pop up on the right.
From here you can add filters, edit social accounts, rename the column or fully delete the column.
Since we want to add a filter, I am going to click on “Filter”.
From here you can filter the column by media type directly related to facebook, such as your posts, comments, inbox messages, replies to comments.
You can also filter by workflow functions such as status, priority, assignment or classification.
I’ll show how to label your posts in a moment.
First, I want a column that shows all the posts my company has created and a column of all the comments we have received.(Demo it).
Let’s do the same thing now, but for a twitter account.
First we’ll create our twitter column.
Then we’ll choose our Twitter social account to bring all the posts.
Let’s filter this column by mentions so we can see who is talking about us, and reach out if we need to.
So we click on the settings cog, then on filter and we only click mentions.
Now we can see who is talking about us.
- Updated April Release:
New sort options:
Oldest first and Filter by Date range.
Customer timeframes limited to 30 days.
{}So, you saw in the filtering options, that you can filter by status, priority etc.{}
{}I now want to show you how to apply those labels to a post.{}
{}This is done in the Post Inspector.{}
To access the Post Inspector, click on any individual post in your column.
The Post Inspector box will show up on the right side of your screen.
From here you can engage with the post by replying, DM, quoting, retweeting or favouriting the post.
Note, these functions are also available directly on the post without going into Post Inspector.
However, you can also apply workflow or a label to a post within the Inspector.
For example, say a post comes in that is negative and you want to ensure it doesn’t get missed.
You could set the status as “Reviewed, determining best response”.
You could then set the priority and assign the post to the appropriate person so they can reach out.
You may also want to apply sentiment, classification or a label which will help with reporting.
So, after we set the status and assign sentiment and classification, you can see that the post in our feed now shows the actions we just took.
When you go back to the Inspector, all the changes are listed in the activity section.
For the Activity section you can also add a note, which will show up on the post in the column.
<size val="1200"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}This is a good time to talk about Macros.{}
</font></size><eff-l val="&lt;a:effectLst/&gt;"><size val="2200"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-lt&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">If you need to take the same actions over and over again, such as assigning positive posts to a specific person and giving them a certain classification or status, you can create a macro.
A macro means you can apply several criteria to a post with just one button click.</font></size>
<size val="1200"> Macros can be created in the main Admin settings.
Click New Macro.
You are going to give the macro a name.
We’ll call ours “____”.
You then choose the workspace you want to assign the macro to.
Since we’re using ____ workspace, I’ll choose that.
Then you simply choose the options you want in your macro.
For example, if we want all postive posts to be assigned to the same person, we’d simply input that criteria, click save and the macro is completed.
Navigate back to your workspace and you will be see the macro is now available in the post inspector.</size></eff-l>
{}Sometimes, you may need to Delete a post.{}
{}Before you choose to delete you’ll want to ensure your have specific guidelines on what posts get deleted.{}
To delete a post  simply click the “trash can” icon.
The post will become greyed out and the next time the column is loaded, the post will be gone.
{}We’ve talked about creating columns with your social accounts like Twitter and Facebook, but you can also show create columns from Topic Profiles{}.
Topic profiles, you’ll remember from the Analyze/ Listen webinar, are customized social searches about any particular topic.
With the appropriate permissions you can create Topic Profiles within Social Studio using Analyze or within the separate app Radian6.
If you need more info on how to create a topic profile, you should check out our many resources or attend the next Listen/ Analyze webinar.
To add a topic profile, go to the workplace settings.
Because Radian6 and Social Studio “talk” to eachother all Topic profiles created in Radian6 are available here and vice versa.
Go back to the workspace and click the engage function.
Add a new column and this time we’ll click Topic Profile.
Select the TP you want to bring in to your column.
You’ll notice all features are the same.
You can use Post Inspector, reply to posts, label them etc.
If you want to get more information on the poster, simply click on their photo icon and you’ll see their bio, twitter stats and all their recent posts.
{}Finally, I just want to show you the create content button.{}
If you are using Publish, you’ll know that this is where you can create a post and put it on your social account.
Simply click, fill in the content you want to publish and select to social account you want to publish to.

Welcome to today’s webinar – Getting Started on the Salesforce Marketing Cloud.
My name is Darryl and I’m a member of the Customer Success team.
I have been with the Marketing Cloud for over 7.5 years now, so I have seen it progress over the years to where it is now, as it is much more customer friendly than where it used to be.
I am currently located in Indianapolis In and if you would like, please let us know where you are located, as it helps us understand what part of the country most are connecting from.
For those of you that are just joining us, please use the question widget to ask your questions or add any comments as well.
My colleague Phil who is also joining us today, will monitor the question widget during the webinar.
Phil please introduce yourself at this time.

{}Objectives:{}
{}Get the Marketing Cloud Connector installed & configured{}
Take the steps to setup the Marketing Cloud Connector & ensure all of your users are fully integrated
We will help you get started in the following areas:
Install the Marketing Cloud Connector Package
Configure your Salesforce Account
{}Speaker1:{}
After today’s session you will be equipped to install the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Connector, formerly known as the v5 integration.
You will also be ready to configure your current Salesforce account with the Salesforce Marketing Cloud account you set up in Module 1 of this Webinar Series.
Let’s get started!
{}Transition to Speaker2 if there is one{}
{}Salesforce Account Setup{}
{}Speaker 2 (if two speakers):{}
Before you can install the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Connector, ensure that you have a Salesforce.com edition that is either Unlimited, Enterprise or Performance.

The Professional Edition is supported in the v2 integration which can be installed using the v2 Integration user guide **which can be found on the Help & Training portal for the Salesforce Marketing Cloud**.</font></eff-l></size>
You will also need one of the following Marketing Cloud accounts:
Core Edition, Advanced Edition, Lock and Publish, Enterprise Edition, Enterprise 2.0 Edition, or Reseller Edition.
<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;2200&quot; b=&quot;0&quot; i=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;a:effectLst/&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;+mn-lt&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:ea typeface=&quot;+mn-ea&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;+mn-cs&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:sym typeface=&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />Please note:
On-Your-Behalf (OYB) accounts are not supported, as those are view only accounts.
And lastly, the appropriate Business Rules are required to be set up in your Salesforce Marketing Cloud account.
If you have any questions around the business rules or need it turned on, please contact your Salesforce Marketing Cloud Account Executive to enable Salesforce integration for your Marketing Cloud account.
Now let’s get started!
{}Tracking User Setup{}
The first step in setting up your Marketing Cloud Connector is to create a new tracking user.
This step enables communication between the Salesforce Marketing Cloud and Salesforce.com environments, creating a “handshake” between them.
It is recommended that the Tracking User is a system user.
First Login to Salesforce.com
<font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}Animation 1:{}

This will bring you to the Setup page within Salesforce.com.
{}Animation 3:{}
Under Manage Users select Users and New User.

The final step is to select a unique name, username and a personal email you can access</font></fill-uf></eff-l></ln></normh></spc></cap></strike></size></km>.
Our advice is to name this tracking user something you can identify {}which MID it will be tracked with.
Here we named it Tracking User- 1382623 because that is the Marketing Cloud MID we will be integrating with.
You can fill in any additional information needed such as a time zone for the user.
{}Refer to the Workbook for Minimum Administration and General Permissions for a tracking user{}
{}Installation{}
Now that you have set up your tracking user, you can now install the Marketing Cloud Connector.
You can find the link to the install package at help.exacttarget.com under Salesforce Marketing Cloud Connector Install Guide and v5 Package Installation.
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;000000&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}Animation 1 {}Copy and paste the most updated version into your browser.

{}Animation 2 {}Upon entering your credentials, it will bring you to the Package Upgrade Details Page.
You can review the package details here and ensure you are installing the correct package.
{}Animation 3:{}
And click Continue
{}Installation{}
You will then be prompted to approve Third-Party Access.
{}Animation 1 {}Check the box to grant access and click continue
{}Animation 2 {}This will bring you to the first page of the installation process where you will need to approve the Package API access….
{}Animation 3: {}….click next
{}Animation 4:{}
The second step is to choose the security level.
The security level will depend on your security preference.
You can grant access to admins only and this will only allow you and users with your profile full access to the integration.
This is best for limited deployments.
Granting access to all users means all internal custom profiles will get full access.
Select Security settings is recommended for most packages and grants users access set by each profile.
{}Animation 5:{}
Select the Security Level that suits your needs
{}Animation 6: {}and{} {}click next
You are now ready to install your package!
This may take a while to install but you will receive an email when the installation is complete.

While the package is installing you can go ahead and add IP addresses to trusted IP ranges in order for your Marketing Cloud and Salesforce accounts to accept the calls.
To add the IP addresses you will need to navigate back to the setup area of your salesforce.com account.
{}Animation 1 {}Once in setup, you’ll need to navigate to Administer portion and select Network Access under Security Controls.
{}Animation 2 {}You will need to click New for each new IP range you enter.
{}Animation 3 {}You will then enter the IP ranges you see on this slide.
You can also find these ranges in your workbook.
It is critical that these IP ranges are entered exactly as they appear.
{}Edit User Page Layout{}
You will want to take the time to make sure your pages include everything we need to support the integration.
To do this you’ll navigate back to Setup and select Customize.
{}Animation 1 {}…Under the Users category, you’ll select the Page Layouts option.
{}Animation 2 {}Once in the User Page Layout screen…..
{}Animation 3: {}….you’ll want to click Edit under User Page Layouts
{}Animation 4:{}
This will bring you to the page where you can select the fields you can enter into the User Page Layout.
{}Animation 5 {}Select Marketing Cloud for AppExchange User and Marketing Cloud for AppExchange Admin
{}Animation 6 {}… and drag them onto the highlighted Additional Information Space.
Make sure you save this user layout
Note: if you are not the admin you will not need to drag the Marketing Cloud for AppExchange Admin Field
{}Enable the Marketing Cloud Connector for Admin User{}
Now that we have added these additional information fields let’s go back to the account that you are logged in as that has a System Administrator Profile.
Under Manage Users in the setup area, click users and click the desired user you need to edit.
{}Animation 1 {}Once in the User Edit screen, you’ll need to scroll down to Additional Information and Select Marketing Cloud for AppExchange User and Marketing Cloud for App Exchange Admin since we will be doing our testing through this account and will need both permissions.
Repeat this process to enable all of the users you need to integrate.
For admins select both options and for General users, select only Marketing Cloud for AppExchange User.
Be sure to click save.
{}Add Custom Links & Related Lists to Contact Page Layouts{}
Now that we have customized our user page layout, we need to customize our Contact page layout with custom links and related lists so that users can access the integration.
This will come in handy when we are sending an email to a particular contact or viewing the tracking analytics for the contact.
You’ll once again navigate to Customize under the App Setup section.
This time we will select Contacts and….
{}Animation 1 {}Select Page Layouts
{}Animation 2 {}and then click Edit under the Contact Layout
{}Animation 3:{}
This will bring you to the edit page for the Contact Layout
{}Animation 4:{}
You will need to click Custom Links
{}Animation 5 {}..
And drag Send Marketing Cloud Email, Marketing Cloud Unsubscribe, Marketing Cloud Re-subscribe and View Marketing Cloud Analytics
{}Animation 6 {}… to the Custom Links area highlighted.
This will allow you to send a Marketing Cloud email to the contact, view the unsubscribes and re-subscribes and view the analytics of the sends.
{}Animation 7:{}
You will also need to add the appropriate links to the Related Lists section of the Contact Page as well.
This will allow you to view a list of email sends to the contact and view individual email results that you can then build a report from.
We will review how to view these and build reports later in this webinar series
{}Animation 8:{}
Select the Related Lists from the left options.
{}Animation 9 {}.. and drag Email Sends and Individual Email Results
{}Animation 10 {}..to the Related Lists area highlighted
{}Customize Contact & Lead Fields{}
The next step is to set the Email Opt Out Field-Level security of your Contacts and Leads.
You’ll need to customize the Email Opt Out Field-Level Security to control the access that user profiles have.
You can choose between visible or read only or both for your users.
To set your field level security, in the App Setup section you’ll want to select Fields from the Contacts menu.
{}Animation 1:{}
You will need to select the Email Opt Out option in the Contacts Standard Fields because this is the field that requires visible level of security
{}Animation 2:{}
This will bring you to the Email Opt Out edit page
{}Animation 3:{}
From this screen you will be able to set your Field Level Security by selecting the Set Field-Level security button.
{}Animation 4:{}
Here you will be able to select what salesforce.com user profiles can have access to the field and pick between read-only and visible.
You will want to make sure that the appropriate user profiles in your organization have access to the field, especially the users who have been granted access to the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Connector.
You will also need to repeat the same process for Lead Fields.
Find Lead under Build, Select Customize, Leads and Fields then choose Email Opt out.
{}Create a Scheduled Send Workflow in Salesforce{}
Now that all of your layouts have been customized, let’s finish up the installation with setting up your workflows.
Workflows rules are critical to any organization because they give you the ability to enforce key business processes easily without having to write code.
In this case our workflows will enforce rules for our Email Send process.
To create workflows, while still in the App Setup portion in Setup and….
{}Animation 1:{}
Select Workflow Rules Under Create select Workflow & Approvals
{}Animation 2:{}
From here you will want to select the New Rule button to create the workflow.
{}Animation 3:{}
This will bring you to the first step in creating the workflow.
{}Animation 4:{}
You will need to select Email Send as the object for the workflow because this is object we want to automate.
Click Next
{}Animation 5:{}
In step 2, you will select the parameters for the workflow rule.
{}Animation 6:{}
Enter the rule name of ScheduledSend, with no spaces and must be typed exactly like this
{}Animation 7:{}
Next, select the Evaluation Criteria option of created.
{}Animation 8:{}
Finally, make sure that the “Run this rule if the following” drop down is set to “criteria are met” and the Field drop down is set to you “Email Send:
Scheduled Date/Time,” the operator is set to “not equal to” and the value field is blank.
{}Animation 9:{}
Once your parameters are set, Click Save and Next
{}Adding Time Triggers{}
Step 3 of creating the workflow requires you to specify a time trigger.
{}Animation 1:{}
Click {}Add Time Trigger {}under {}Time-Dependent Workflow Actions{}
{}Animation 2:{}
This will allow you to create the time trigger.
Ensure that the workflow rule is set to 0 Hours After Email Send Scheduled Date/Time and click save
{}Adding a Field Update & Activate{}
We now need to add a Field Update to our Time Dependent Workflow Action we just created.
A Field update is an action that is associated with a workflow rule.
In this case we are using the action DelayedSend.
To start adding a field update we need to select an existing action to update.
{}Animation 1:{}
This can be found under the Time Dependent Workflow Action we just created
{}Animation 2: {}in the Add Workflow Action Dropdown menu. Select, select existing action
{}Animation 3:{}
This will bring you to an edit page where you will be able to select your action.
{}Animation 4:{}
For the Search drop down, select Field Update
{}Animation 5:{}
Then move Field Update: DelayedSend from Available actions to Selected Actions by clicking the Add arrow so that your selection looks it does on the screen shot.
{}Animation 6:{}
Click Save and then Done.
{}Animation 7:{}
The final set is to make sure you activate your Rule by clicking Activate.
Once you click Activate, choose a Default Workflow User (Preferably an Admin), click save, the button will change to Deactivate and you will see a checkmark to acknowledge the rule is activated
You will need to create one more workflow rule using the same process.
This workflow rule will use the same object, Email Send, and be titled BackupWorkflow (with no spaces & exactly like this) and will be necessary to backup your Email Sends automatically.
Set the Evaluation Criteria to Evaluate the rule when a record is: Created, and any time it’s edited to subsequently meet criteria.
Run this rule when “Criteria are Met” and enter the following Rule Criteria Email Send: Backup Workflow Date/Time not equal to (blank).
Add the time trigger Set this Workflow Rule to 0 Hours After Email Send: Backup Workflow Date/Time and add the Field Update: UnpopulateBackupWorkflow.
Make sure to click Activate and you are finished creating your workflows!
{}User Configuration in the Marketing Cloud{}
Now that we’ve concurred the installation let’s make sure that our Salesforce account is configured with our Marketing Cloud account
{}Set Salesforce Tracking User in the Marketing Cloud{}
Our next step is to integrate our Marketing Cloud users with the salesforce.com users.
Remember, there is a one-to-one relationship for this, meaning that one Marketing Cloud user is associated with one salesforce.com User.
To do so we will need to log into our Marketing Cloud account we set up in the first webinar of this series.
{}Animation 1:{}
In the Admin tab, you will select the Salesforce Integration option from the left navigation.
{}Animation 2:{}
Next you will need to add your Tracking User Name and Password you set up within salesforce.com in the Configurations Settings in the workspace so that the Marketing Cloud can complete the handshake.
{}Animation 3:{}
Once you have entered this information, your Salesforce Org ID should populate.
If it does not, you must use the magnifying glass to search for an Org ID
You have the option of selecting Scope By User here.
Let’s dive in next on whether this option might be useful for you…
{}Scope By User vs Non-Scope By User{}
{}Scope By User{}
{}Non Scope By User{}
Limited to what is visible by the user initiating the send
Not limited to what is visible to the user initiating the send
Works well if migrating from v3 to v5 integrations
Works well if migrating from v2 to v5 integrations
User must enter their Salesforce password
An admin can set up a user without entering a password
When user’s password expires, that user must update their Salesforce password in the Marketing Cloud
Passwords do not expire
{}With a Scope By User configuration{}, Reports and Campaign that are visible to the user initiating the send are available for this selection within the Salesforce Marketing Cloud as a target audience for reports and campaigns.
Subscribers are filtered based on the user initiating the send.
The list of Subscribers returned is limited to what the user initiating the send has access to view.
{}For a Scope By User configuration you may want to consider a few things.{}
Within the Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Report and/or Campaign lists are limited to what is visible by the user initiating the send.
The send behavior described above is the default behavior for SFv3 accounts, making this a favorable option of existing SFv3 customers who wish to migrate to SFv5
Users must enter their Salesforce password during the integration User process in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud
When a user’s Salesforce password expires, that user must update their Salesforce password on the Salesforce Marketing Cloud
{}With a Non- Scope By User configuration{}, Subscribers who are visible or accessible to the Tracking User can be retrieved from reports or campaigns.
Often, the Tracking User is an Administrator within Salesforce with wide-ranging access.
Thus, the list of subscribers returned from each report or campaign includes all subscribers visible to this user.
Subscribers are not filtered based on the user running the report which is the biggest difference between the two configuration options.
{}For a Non-Scope By User configuration you may want to consider a few things.{}
The send behavior described above is the default for SFv2 accounts, making this a favorable option for existing SFv2 customers who wish to migrate to SFv5
Within the Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Report and/or Campaign lists are not limited to what is visible to the user initiated send
Within the Salesforce Marketing Cloud, returned Subscribers are not limited to only those visible to the user initiating the send
Password policies are not in effect, making this configuration easy to maintain because passwords do not expire
An Administrator can set up a user without entering a password
A potential risk would be if a user could mistakenly sends to a Report and/or Campaign members who are not visible to that user without notice.
This is the biggest difference between the two configurations.
{}Please refer to the workbook for more review of which configuration would work best for your account{}
{}API User Setup in the Marketing Cloud{}
We also need to set up our API user in the Marketing Cloud.
To do this you will set up a user as we did in the first webinar of the series.
While in the Admin tab, you will navigate to My Users under the Account Settings folder and click create.
{}Animation 1:{}
When creating your user, you will want to name your new user something that is easily identifiable such as API and the associated MID number or if you have an existing integration, the current API user can be used.
You’ll also enter the email address and enter a unique username.
You can leave the External key field blank and select a time zone and culture code.
{}Animation 2:{}
The important difference between the users we created in the first webinar and for the API user is to make sure that the API User box is checked.
You will also need to enter a temporary password and re-enter the password to verify  and finally click save.
{}Animation 3:{}
Once the user is created, we also need to manage their roles.
In the user workspace, you will need to check the user you just created and select manage roles from the navigation bar.
{}Animation 4:{}
This will take you to the roles workspace where you can select the appropriate roles for the API user.
{}Animation 5:{}
If you have an Enterprise 2.0 account, you will need to give the API user access to ALL Business Units that will use the Connector and must be set as the Parent for default.
{}Animation 6:{}
Edit Roles to include {}Administrator{} and {}Marketing Cloud Administration{}
{}Animation 7:{}
For non Enterprise 2.0 Accounts there is a slightly different editing screen for the API user.
The general settings will look the same as just discussed but the permissions section is slightly different.
{}Animation 8:{}
In the Select Applications for user section under Marketing Cloud Permissions and Roles, select {}Email{}.
{}Animation 9: {}and Under Specify Marketing Roles, select {}Marketing Cloud Administrator{}
{}Integrate your API User in Marketing Cloud{}
The last part in setting up your API User is to integrate the Marketing Cloud API User with the Sales Cloud Tracking user.
This is the primary process for integrating any user.
While still in the My Users workspace, click on the user you want to integrate.
Click on the API user we have been setting up to get taken to the General Settings workspace.
{}Animation 1 {}Click the blue {}Integrate {}link for{} Salesforce.com Status.{}
{}Animation 2 {}Enter Salesforce Tracking User login id{}.{}
Optionally, if Scope by User is selected, enter Salesforce Tracking User password
Click Save Settings
{}Integrating Existing Users{}
We will now integrate our existing users that need access to the Marketing Cloud Connector

There are slightly different steps to manage different types of users.
As mentioned before, a user can either be a Scope By User or a Non Scope By User.
There are different account types as well including Enterprise 2.0 and Non Enterprise 2.0.
To help break this down, please refer to the flow chart.
{}If you have an Enterprise 2.0 account with Scope By User configuration {}you will need to manage your Business Units and give minimum permissions including Content Creator and Marketing Cloud Viewer.
A Content Creator role can access all facets of content creation, but they have no control over other aspects of the Salesforce Marketing Cloud application such as subscriber information and tracking results.
This user produces the images and words that will be used in the actual messages which are then approved and sent by other roles.
The Marketing Cloud viewer permission allows the user to view messages in the Marketing Cloud.
{}For an Enterprise 2.0 account with a Non Scope By User configuration{}, you will need to again manage your Business Units as well as set minimum permissions.
These include Content Creator the same role as before but two additional permissions; Data Manager and Marketing Cloud Content Editor/Publisher.
The data manager role  allows the user to maintain subscriber records and any publication or suppression lists and handles data imports and exports.
The database marketer may have to create relationships that span multiple business units, but this role usually doesn’t create or edit the content itself.
The Marketing Cloud Content Editor/ Publisher allows the user to edit and publish content.
{}If you account is a Non Enterprise 2.0 account{}, it’s time to listen up!
A scope by user will need to set the following permissions:
Content Creator and Marketing Viewer.
These are the same permissions as an Enterprise 2.0 account scope by user.
{}If your account is a Non Enterprise 2.0 account and you have a non scope by user {}you need to integrate, you may need to go about it a slightly different way than the others types.
The Manage Roles button is not active in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Core and Enterprise 1.0 account.
So in this case you will need to scroll down in the edit user record screen to Permissions and Roles and select the following:
Grant the user access to the web service which will allow the user to create web service API calls for the Salesforce Marketing Cloud system to process.
Manage Data Extension Data and Retention Policy to allow the user to set their account’s data retention policy and
Administrative Data Management to access the data retention policies for data extensions and also allow access to Manage Salesforce Data features to delete data stored in the Salesforce Database
We will go into detail of how to set up these users next.
{}Manage Roles & Business Units<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />Non Scope by User- Enterprise 2.0 Account{}
Once the users have been integrated by clicking the blue integrate button in the edit screen for the existing user you want to integrate, we now need to set up the users roles, and if you have an Enterprise 2.0 account, you’ll need to set up their business units.
To update their roles, you will need to be in the My User workspace in the admin tab of your Marketing Cloud account.
{}Animation 1:{}
Check the User you just integrated
{}Animation 2: {}and click Manage Roles
{}Animation 3:{}
This will bring you to the workspace for managing that user’s roles.
{}Animation 4:{}
If you have an Enterprise 2.0 account, here is where you can select any Business Unit or select a specific business unit for this user to access
{}Animation 5:{}
Click Edit Roles and include the following Roles:
Content Creator, Data Manager and Marketing Cloud Content Editor/Publisher
Repeat this process for all integration users
{}Manage Roles<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />Non Scope by User – Core and Enterprise 1.0 Accounts{}
For Non Enterprise 2.0 accounts there is no Manage Roles or Manage Business Units buttons and the way to set up these users is a little different.
Just as before you will go to My Users under Admin
{}Animation 1: {}… and instead of checking the box next to the user you want to set up, you’ll want to instead click the Name link
{}Animation 2:{}
This will bring up an overview of the general settings & permissions for the user
{}Animation 3:{}
Click edit to change to manage your roles
{}Animation 4:{}
This enables you to edit the sections.
Ensure that the Enabled and API User boxes are checked under the General Settings sections
{}Animation 5:{}
Under User Permissions , select the following:
Grant the user access to the web service
Manage Data Extension Data and Retention Policy
Administrative Data Management
{}Animation 6:{}
Under Marketing Cloud Permissions and Roles select Email for step 1: select Applications for user
{}Animation 7: {}… and check Marketing Cloud Content Editor/ Publisher for step 2: specifying Marketing Cloud Roles for user
Repeat this process for all integration users
{}Manage Roles and Business Units<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />Scope by User{}
If your organization will be using the Scope By User configuration, you will need to manage the roles and business units prior to integrating the user unlike we have done before.
We will now walk you through the steps for integrating a scope by user account.
Under My Users in the admin tab you will check the box next to the existing user you wish to edit their roles for.
{}Animation 1:{}
Select Manage Roles from the navigation
{}Animation 2:{}
This will bring you to the workspace where you can edit roles for your user.
{}Animation 3:{}
If you have an Enterprise 2.0 account, select any Business Unit or select a specific business unit for this user to access.
{}Animation 4:{}
You will need to edit the roles to include the following roles:
Content Creator and Marketing Cloud Viewer.
You may include additional roles as well if needed.
Click Save
{}Integrating your Scope by User{}
Now that we have set up our roles and permissions we can now integrate the user.
The integration steps are slightly different for a Scope By User…
{}Animation 1 {}You’ll need to select Cloud Preferences under your Name in to the top right corner
{}Animation 2 {}This will bring you to general settings where you can click the blue integrate button
{}Animation 3 {}and enter your Salesforce.com Username and Password
You have now learned how to integrate both a scope by user and non scope by user in all Marketing Cloud Editions.
{}Salesforce System Configuration{}
Let’s now configure our Salesforce account to complete the integration!
{}Adding Tabs{}
Add the Marketing Cloud, Email Sends, and Send Analytics tabs to your salesforce.com instance. :
Now that we have successfully installed our Marketing Cloud Connector and configured it to our Marketing Cloud Account, we have a few final steps to complete back in our instance of salesforce.com.
We will first need to add tabs to be able to access the Marketing Cloud from Salesforce.
{}Animation 1:{}
Click the + button next to your current last tab….
{}Animation 2: {}… and select customize my tabs.
{}Animation 3:{}
This will bring you to a screen where you can customize the tabs available for quick and easy access.
{}Animation 4:{}
You want to be sure to select the Marketing Cloud, Email Sends and Send Analytics from the available tabs and select add to move them over to your selected tabs.
{}Animation 5:{}
You can also customize the order of your tabs by moving tabs up or down based on your preference.
{}Animation 6:{}
The final step is to click Save
{}Service Cloud Configuration{}
If you are a Service Cloud User you will need to take slightly different steps to configure the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Application
After logging into Salesforce.com you’ll go to setup and under Create
Animation 1:
Select Apps
Animation 2: and select New.
We will need to create a custom Marketing Cloud app.
Animation 3:
A editing screen will come up where you can label this app:
Marketing Cloud and the App name will auto fill
Animation 4:
Click Next
{}Service Cloud Configuration{}
{}Animation 1:{}
You will then be asked to choose a logo (this is optional) and click next
{}Animation 2:{}
This will bring you the second step of the custom app wizard where you can add your tabs
{}Animation 3:{}
Select Marketing Cloud, Email Sends and Send Analytics from Available tabs and add them to Selected Tabs.
These are the same tabs as we added previously
{}Animation 4:{}
Click Next
{}Animation 5:{}
This brings you to step 4 where you can assign this Marketing Cloud app to certain profiles.
{}Animation 6:{}
Select which profiles you’d like for the app to be accessible to and click save
{}Selecting Triggered Sends{}
{}Speaker1 {}Now that we have set up our tabs we will need to complete some prerequisites before configuring the Marketing Cloud with our Salesforce account.
We need to set up a small APEX code in order for our two instances to “talk” to each other.
This will affect the triggers that we will create.
Triggered Email Sends allows Marketing Cloud Connector customers to create and send automated messages to Salesforce contact, lead or person account records when object records are created and/or updated.
In order to create a trigger you must set up a small APEX code for each object you plan on using as a trigger.
Let’s get into how we are going to set this up…
{}Animation 1:{}
In Salesforce, under setup select customize where you will find a list of objects that you can set up as triggers.
{}Animation 2:{}
For this example we are choosing the object, Lead.
{}Animation 3:{}
Under Lead select Triggers
{}Animation 4:{}
Here you can select New and we can enter an APEX code that will connect our trigger.
{}Animation 5:{}
This will bring up Apex Trigger Editing Screen
{}Animation 6:{}
First you’ll want to make sure your Apex trigger is active, so be sure to check the Is Active box
{}Animation 7:{}
Next you’ll want to enter in the code shown in the editing box exactly how it is and change the object for each additional apex trigger you create.
In this case you would swap out the word Lead for a different object.
You can copy and paste this code from help.exacttarget.com and searching Triggered Sends.
You can also find out more about triggered sends there as well.
*** I am not able to find the apex code in help, so not sure if that language needs to be removed or the link to take you there.
If it is there, not easy to find.
*** Also, when I enter the code above, I get an error that I am not able to figure out.
{}Animation 8:{}
Click Save when you are finished and repeat this process for every object you plan on using a trigger for
{}Selecting Send Types{}
Enter API user credentials from Marketing Cloud
Add Email for Send Type
Now that we have our apex codes set up in order to connect our triggered sends, let’s click into the Marketing Cloud tab to complete the configuration within your salesforce.com instance.
{}Animation 1:{}
First you will be prompted to enter the credentials for the API user that was created in the Marketing Cloud.
Remember, the API user is required to have Admin permissions in the marketing cloud.
Use the default Authorization API URL unless you are specifically instructed to change it by the Marketing Cloud.
Click Next
{}Animation 2:{}
This will take you to the next screen where you will see your Marketing Cloud Configuration.
{}Animation 3:{}
Under the Send Type, you will need to select Email from the Not Selected list and move it to the selected list
{}Select Send Options{}
{}Animation 1:{}
The next section on this screen will be the environment where you will see the URLs for the various APIs.
Remember, keep the API URLS as is unless specifically told to change them
{}Animation 2:{}
Under the Send Recipients you can choose your Send Recipients for Target Audiences and Exclusions Audiences.
You will want to click add and move for Report and Campaign so that they appear in your selected option.
This will give you the ability to send to reports and campaigns via the integration.
{}Animation 3:{}
If you will be using exclusion audiences in your send, you can also move Report and Campaign to your selected box as well.
This is optional but recommended if you every foresee the need to exclude certain audiences from sends.
{}Animation 4:{}
Select your sender options by checking the alternate reply-to to allow integration users to select from a configurable list of names and email addresses where replies are sent.
Reply Mail Management must be enabled and configured in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud for Reply-To Options to work
{}Selecting Triggered Sends{}
{}Speaker1 {}Next you’ll need to choose your restrictions for triggered sends.
{}Animation 1 {}You can allow only administrators or both admins and standard users to create triggered sends
{}Animation 2 {}Make sure you enable all of the objects that you’ll need for triggered sends by adding objects from not selected to the selected panel.
{}Animation 3 {}…and adjusting the position with the up and down arrows.
These are the objects that we previously created APEX code for.
Each trigger requires an object with the APEX code enabled.
{}Animation 4 {}Choose a support ticket recipient and choose to select the Retry option that indicates the system will retry the send if the system is temporarily unavailable.
The option to cancel the send will stop it form be retried further
{}Animation 5 {}You’ll need to choose the tracking level preferences.
There are 4 different forms of tracking details that you can choose from.
{}Aggregate Level Tracking {}provides a comprehensive summary of Email Send statistics.
This can viewed graphically in the Tracking Info section of the Email Send record.
{}Individual Level Tracking{} provides email performance tracking information down to the Contact or Lead Level.
They can be viewed in the Individual Email Result record which is accessible from the Related List on the Email Send record or from Contact or Lead record.
{}Track Link Details{} allows individual subscriber link tracking data such as links clicked or number of clicks to be stored in Salesforce.
This consumes additional Salesforce storage.
This preference provides Link Tracking information for each individual Lead or Contact that is part of a send.
{}Track Sent Events{} stores Individual Subscriber-level tracking data in Salesforce after an email is sent.
If this option is not selected, this data is stored in Salesforce only after a subscriber takes action such as opening an email or clicking a link.
This tracking option may consume a large amount of data.
{}Animation 6 {}You can change the frequency  that you will receive tracking
{}Animation 7 {}and change the number of days to track
{}Business Unit Setup– Enterprise 2.0 Accounts{}
For Enterprise 2.0 Accounts you will need to manage your Business Units.

In the Email Sends tab you can access the basic integration features
{}Animation 1 {}such as A/B Testing,
{}Animation 2 {}Triggered Sends
{}Animation 3 {}and also navigate back to the Marketing Cloud
{}Animation 4 {}Here you will also configure your Marketing Cloud Connector
{}Animation 5 {}In the Marketing Cloud Configuration Screen you can navigate back to Email Sends,
{}Animation 6 {}manage your business units,
{}Animation 7 {}manage your users,
{}Animation 8 {}manage email linkages,
{}Animation 9 {}manage tracking data
{}Animation 10 {}and change your API User
{}Animation 11 {}Select manage business units and here you can choose which business units you will be using
{}Animation 12 {}Select the enabled check box next to the business unit or units you need
Click Save
{}User Setup{}
{}Animation 1 {}From the Marketing Cloud Configuration screen you can also Manage Users
{}Animation 2 {}and select the users that you wish to have access
{}Note:{}
Setting up users in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud first allows the administrator to use the dropdown menu to display only Integrated Users.
This allows administrators to see a list of users who should receive permissions and prevents the need to switch back and forth between the Salesforce Marketing Cloud and Salesforce to see who should be given permissions.
Users will have to enter their Marketing Cloud credentials the first time they use the Marketing Cloud Connector

{}Supported Browsers{}
Internet Explorer
Version 9
Firefox
Latest Version
Chrome
Latest Version
Safari
Version 5.1, 6, 7
Before logging into the Salesforce Marketing Cloud, I want to cover what browsers are supported.
As you can see,  Internet Explorer 9 and higher, the latest version of Firefox and Chrome, and Safari versions 5.1, 6, and 7 are all supported browsers.
We have found that generally Firefox seems to be a customer favorite, but Power Users who will be working with AMPScript – which is the Salesforce Marketing Cloud’s proprietary scripting language – may want to use Chrome instead.
The coding seems to work better in that browser for most customers.
{}Logging into your account{}
From the Salesforce Marketing Cloud website:
By typing <fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;E98300&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">mc.exacttarget.com</fill-sd><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;009AA6&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"> </fill-sd>directly into your browser address bar.
{}Speaker 1:{}
The first thing we are going to cover is how to access the Marketing Cloud.
Using your preferred supported browser, you can either log in from the website www.exacttarget.com by navigating to the login button in the top right corner and selecting the Marketing Cloud.
Or you can type mc.exacttarget.com directly into your browser’s address bar and that will take you directly to the login page.
If anyone is having any issues accessing either one of those sites, you can try logging out of your vpn and trying again.
Or if you are at work, it could possibly be your company’s firewall preventing you from accessing the site.
In that case, please reach out to your IT Team to allow you to have access.
Phil, have you seen this type of issue before with your account or with customers?
{}Logging into your account{}
If you have not received your login credentials, contact your Administrator
{}Speaker 1:{}
The login screen is fairly straightforward – you will need to enter your username and password and click the login button to access the Marketing Cloud.
You may select the “Remember Me” feature which will save your username for future visits.
It is important to note that for security reasons, it will not save your password.
From the login screen you can also click the “Forgot Password” link to obtain a new password if you forgot yours.
Once you click login, your browser may ask you if you would like to save your password, please note, that is not the Marketing Cloud, but your actual browser.
So we are not able to access that information.
Before we move on, please let me know if you are having any issues at this point.
Phil will be checking for any responses in the question widget.
{}Your First Login{}
Change your password and set a challenge question
The Marketing Cloud employs double authentication.
You will be promoted to activate your account.
{}Speaker 1:{}
Upon your first login, you will be prompted to change your password, set up a challenge question, and input an activation code.
The Marketing Cloud employs double authentication, so you will be asked to enter an activation code.
After you have clicked the “Send Activation Email” button, the email address associated with the your username will be sent an email with that code.
You will simply copy and paste the activation code into the appropriate box and click submit.
If you don’t receive your activation code immediately, be sure to check your junk folder as spam filtering software sometimes send automated emails to the junk folder.
If you do not receive the email, you can reach out to <lnk-c val="&lt;a:hlinkClick r:id=&quot;rId3&quot;/&gt;">{}help@exacttarget.com</lnk-c>{} and/or your IT Team for assistance.
As your spam filtering software more than likely did not allow it to be delivered or it is still processing through your software checks.
If anyone has not received it, please let me know in the question widget.
Phil, do you have any examples of customer’s having this issue and how they proceeded?
{}Marketing Cloud Home Screen Navigation{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Now that you are logged into the account, let’s take a look at the first screen you will see, which is the dashboard.
The dashboard displays an overview of the features available in your account and any associated activities, such as past or future sends and campaign information.
This is the main starting point when you log into the Marketing Cloud.
{}Animation 1:{}
At the top left of the screen, you will see the persistent toolbar where you can gain access to the Calendar, Pulse, Campaigns, and Playbooks.
Playbooks are customer lifecycle automated messages set up through an easy to use program in which no technical expertise is required.
There are currently 3 Playbooks available – Welcome Series, Customer Anniversary, and Birthday Email.
{}Animation 2:{}
The calendar provides a weekly or monthly view of all past or scheduled interactions.
You can filter the calendar views by campaign or interaction type.
{}Animation 3:{}
Pulse displays real-time stats for your marketing activities, such as ongoing email sends.
It also allows you to see how many facebook fans or twitter follows are accessing your company pages and it resets everyday.
{}Animation 4:{}
Campaigns enable you to easily plan, coordinate, and measure cross-channel campaigns in real time.
{}Animation 5:{}
The App Switcher refers to the icons that represent the different Marketing Cloud applications and are grouped by channel.
The App Switcher will show apps enabled in your account as well as apps you may want to explore for future use.
The apps not enabled in your account are easily distinguished by the lowercase I on the upper right corner of the icon.
{}Animation 6:{}
You determine if all apps or just my apps are shown in the app switcher by toggling between the 2 preferences.
The My Apps preference will only show apps that you have access to in your account.
{}Live Demonstration:<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" /><size val="3600">{}Marketing Cloud Navigation</size>{}{}
Now let’s take a look at this feature in a live environment, give me just a moment to set this up.
{}Marketing Cloud Home Screen Navigation{}
{}IN APPLICATION<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;2400&quot; i=&quot;1&quot; kern=&quot;1200&quot;&gt;&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:effectLst/&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;+mn-lt&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:ea typeface=&quot;+mn-ea&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;+mn-cs&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />{}{}Speaker 2:{}
Now let’s determine how to find out account information.
In the top right corner you will see your account name.
Hover over your account name to find your Member Account ID, or MID.
You will need to know your MID when you are logging a case with Global Support.
To the right of your account name, you will see your display name.
If you hover over your name you will find user preference, administration, help and 3sixty, so you can access those items from there.
For this session though, we will select the email application from the app switcher and access the admin section from there.
{}Email Application Home Screen Navigation{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
This is the first screen you will see each time you enter the email application.
{}Animation 1:{}
From this screen you will be able to use the persistent toolbar which provides access to the Content tab – where you will manage your content for emails, Subscribers – where you will manage subscriber data, Interactions – where you can manage activities and messages for automation, Tracking Tab – which allows you to track the activity of your email campaigns, and the Admin Tab – where account administrators can define account settings, create users, and other administrator tasks.
{}Animation 2:{}
In the recent items area you can quickly see the newest items created or modified in your account.
You can customize this to be items you’ve created in the account or items created by team members.
{}Animation 3:{}
You can also easily see tracking highlights from recent sends in your account.
Under pending, will be any future email sends from your account.<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;2400&quot; kern=&quot;1200&quot;&gt;&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:effectLst/&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;+mn-lt&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:ea typeface=&quot;+mn-ea&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;+mn-cs&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />{}Animation 4:{}
Shortcuts allow you to jump to certain parts of the application such as creating an email or creating a template.
You can customize your short cuts to fit your preferences depending on what areas of the application you access the most frequently.
{}Animation 5:{}
You can also get the latest information from the Salesforce Marketing Cloud via the announcement section of the home screen.
{}Navigation{}
Toolbar
Work space
Show or hide menu
Menu
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Once you select a tab from the persistent toolbar, you will be taken into the workspace for that section.
While what you are able to accomplish depends on where you are, there are similar navigations throughout the application.
{}Animation 1:{}
The menu for the tab you have selected appears on the left side of the screen; this is where you will navigate to different functions (such as emails or templates in the screen shot).
{}Animation 2:{}
The workspace has the majority of the screen real estate and will be where you will do the majority of your work.
{}Animation 3:{}
The toolbar is what appears at the top of your work space.
The toolbar does not appear on the initial home page, but when you have selected a tab in the navigation pane, customized tool bars will appear depending on the tab you have chosen.
{}Animation 4:{}
As you work within the email application, you may find it advantageous for the workspace to expand – you can do this by hiding the menu.
The menu is easily hidden or shown by clicking the arrow bar.
{}Creating Folders{}
Folders are a great way to keep your account organized and to easily access what you need.
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
In each menu, you also have the ability to create additional folders to help keep your account organized.
Creating additional folders is easy.
You will right click on the folder you’d like to create the new one under, select New Folder from the menu and name the folder.
You can now create content, emails, lists, and other items in your new folder depending on which tab you created the folder in.
{}Admin Tab{}
{}Speaker 2:{}
Next we will cover what you can manage within the Admin section of the email application.
Remember, to see the admin tab and manage the items we are about to cover you must have administrator privileges within the email application.
{}Account Settings{}
This area of the Admin tab is designed to allow Administrator level users to manage:
Account Information
Security Settings
Physical mailing address displayed in email footers.
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 2:{}
First lets cover the Account Settings section in the Admin tab.
This section allows administrators to manage account information,  security settings, as well as the physical mailing address displayed in email footers.
{}Account Settings{}
The Account Settings Folder allows you to update:
General Settings
Company Information
The address displayed in Company Information is the address which is included in the footer for each email for CAN-SPAM compliance.
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 2:{}
Account settings allow you to configure general settings for the account, including timezone and date format.
{}Animation 1:{}
This is the general time for the account, each user has their own timezone setting.
{}Animation 2:{}
You can also update company information, including Name and address from account settings.
You will want to ensure that the address for your company is accurate as this is where the address is retrieved from.
You also have the option of using multiple physical addresses in your account, please ask for additional information if needed.
{}Header and Footer Management{}
Speaker 1:
With our latest release, you can also manage your account Headers and Footers in the Account Settings section of the Admin tab without having to call into Marketing Cloud Global Support.
Headers and Footers are important because they help you ensure your emails are CAN-SPAM compliant.
You can set headers and footers for your HTML and Text versions of emails.
You can still use the system default, create a customer header or footer by pasting in HTML or select none if your header and footer information is included in the template or HTML for an email.
{}Subscription Details{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 2:{}
You can also view subscription details in account settings.
This area is strictly informational and will display your subscription dates, you can run the available report to get the results of your recent sends.
That report is also available in tracking.
{}Security Settings{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 2:{}
Next item we will cover is security settings.
You can modify the session settings, username and login expirations including lockouts, password policies, and content preview settings.
{}Animation 1:{}
In session settings, you can change the default session timeout, which is the amount of inactive time a user can remain logged into the account.
The default is 20 minutes but can be increased up to eight hours.
You can also set whether or not a secure connection is required.
{}Animation 2:{}
Username and logins allows you to configure a login expiring due to inactivity, when an account will be locked out due to incorrect password entry, and the minimum username length.
In this section you can also setup your account to bypass the authentication process by saving your ip addresses.
We will demo this feature in just a few moments.
{}Animation 3:{}
You can also set password policies in this section like the minimum character length, the complexity, enforce password history, and the length of time a password is valid.
You also have the option to exclude designated API users to be exempt from the password expiration rule.
And  for the “Send password change confirmation email”, it will send you an email when your password has been changed.
{}Live Demonstration:<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" /><size val="3600">{}Settings</size>{}{}
Now let’s take a look at this feature in a live environment, give me just a moment to set this up.
{}Business Units{}
A business unit allows you to control your brand while enabling access to messaging technologies.
A parent/child structure
Can be organized in any way to support your business
Can limit data visible to business units (i.e. AMER only sees AMER subscribers, APAC only sees APAC subscribers)
Now that we’ve set up the account settings, let’s talk about business units and reasons why you might use them for your organization.
Business units allow you to control data for purposes such as branding and regulatory compliance for direct email marketing campaigns but still provide access to the Marketing Cloud to other areas of your organization.
It is important to point out that business units are implemented in a hierarchical, parent/child structure.
A business unit is a hierarchical administration structure that controls access to information and sharing of information.
All items created in a business unit are accessible to all users working in that business unit.
Items can be shared with other users in other business units by placing them into a shared items folder, located in the Content and Subscriber sections of the applications.
Business units can also manage the visibility of data within an account using a hierarchical structure, which can be organized in any way to match your business needs.
When setting up your business units you can mirror workflow processes, demographic and behavioral data about your subscribers, or your organization's operational structure – which ever works best for you organization.
As an administrator, a business unit also allows you to manage user roles for the business unit, view users who have access to the business unit, and define filter criteria for subscribers.
{}Creating a Business Unit{}
Creating Business Units is easy in your Marketing Cloud account!
{}Animation 1:{}
To begin creating a business unit navigate to the {}Admin {}tab in your account and click {}Business Units.{}
{}Animation 2:{}
From the toolbar within the Business Unit workspace click the {}create {}button.
This will open up the {}New Business Unit{} workspace where you will complete the {}Properties {}section and the {}Physical Address{} section.
Depending on how you are setting up your business units, you may need to have a different physical address than your Parent business unit.
For example, if you are setting up your business units based on country that your organization has office in and you want the physical address to be the office in that country.
The next section you will need to complete is the {}Unsubscribe Settings{} sections.
As an Enterprise 2.0 administrator you can manage how business unit level unsubscribes are handled and ensure it works best for your organization.
Two options are available under the properties settings of a business unit:
Subscribers will be unsubscribed from all business units in the Enterprise
Subscribers will be unsubscribed from this business unit only
If you pick the “Subscribers will be unsubscribed from all business units in the Enterprise” option the following will happen:
When a subscriber is unsubscribed in All subscribers from a business unit, the subscriber is unsubscribed in the All Subscriber list at the enterprise level.
Activating a subscriber in All Subscribers list at business unit level does not activate the subscriber at the business unit level.
This is because the subscriber is unsubscribed in the All Subscriber list at the enterprise level (master unsubscribed) and that trumps the business unit level.
Activating the subscriber in All Subscribers at the enterprise level does not activate the subscriber at the business unit level.
This is because the subscriber is unsubscribed in the All Subscriber list at the business unit level.
In order for a subscriber to be reactivated the subscriber must be activated at the enterprise and business unit levels.
If you pick the “Subscribers will be unsubscribed from this business unit only.” option the following will happen:
Unsubscribing a subscriber in All Subscribers at business unit level does not unsubscribe the subscriber in the All Subscriber list at the enterprise level.
Activating the subscriber in the All Subscrbers list at the business unit level activates the subscriber at the business unit level.
{}Live Demonstration:<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />{}Business Units{}{}
Now let’s take a look at this feature in a live environment, give me just a moment to set this up.
{}My Users{}
Manage Salesforce Marketing Cloud users in your organization:
Create new users and specify permissions to the application and the Marketing Cloud (Marketing Cloud)
Update permissions
Disable users
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Next we are going to cover how to manage Users by clicking on the My Users bullet point under Account Settings.
This is where you will create new users, disable users, and update permissions.
Now lets walk through how to create new users and the first step is to click create from the toolbar.
{}My Users – Creating a New User{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
On the next screen, you will provide the information needed to create a new user:
{}Animation 1:{}
Add the full name that will appear in the application and in email sends, then complete the other fields including the timezone for that user.
When setting the temporary password, please note that criteria is at least 8 characters with one number and one special character as a part of those 8.
{}Animation 2:{}
You will also set the email permissions for the user on this screen.
For additional information on user permissions please look in your workbook you received when registering for this webinar.
<size val="2400"><kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><eff-l val="&lt;a:effectLst/&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-lt&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}Animation 3:{}
Another important step when creating or managing your users is defining the Marketing Cloud application access.
Here you can </font></eff-l></fill-sd></kern></size>select applications, such as Email, MobileConnect or Automation Studio, that the user will have access to.
It is generally recommended that users be given access to only the areas and functions that they need.
You can give additional access to the user later if needed.
{}Animation 4{}:
Then set the Marketing Cloud permissions based on the level of access the user requires.
The definition for each permission is on the right side.
{}File Location & Key Management{}
You are also able to connect your company’s FTP server directly to your Marketing Cloud account.
This will allow you to import data directly from your company FTP site or vice versa, eliminating the step of downloading data from your company server, to then import into your marketing cloud account.
To set this up, you will click create from the toolbar and complete the necessary properties information, the name is required, but external key and description are optional.
Then choose the location type, but you will need the URL, username and password  from your IT Team.
Key management allows you to manage your AES encryption and decryption options for your emails, landing pages and the ftp file transfers.
<size val="2200"><eff-l val="&lt;a:effectLst/&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-lt&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">You would first have to add the salesforce marketing cloud public key or your IT team can acquire a public or private key if you prefer to use your own.
That key will be attached to every transfer to or from your company’s ftp server.
</font></eff-l></size>You can use 5 different methods of encryption, choose the one that meets your needs.
To create a key management file, click create and complete the necessary information.
{}Live Demonstration:<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" /><size val="3600">{}File Location and Users</size>{}{}
Now let’s take a look at this feature in a live environment, give me just a moment to set this up.
{}Send Management{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
The next area of the Admin tab we will cover is the Send Management section.
This is where you will configure Send Definitions which are comprised of a sender profile, a delivery profile, and a send classification.
We will begin by looking at how we create a sender and delivery profile before we dive into Send Classifications.
{}Sender Profile{}
A sender profile defines the “who” aspect of your email send – who is the
email from and what is the from address.
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
A sender profile allows you to define the “who” aspects of an email.
It includes the From information for a message.
You can reuse this information and it is chosen at send time.
This is a great opportunity to personalize or brand the from name and from email address for your subscribers across numerous sends.
To create a sender profile, click the create button from the toolbar and give it a name.
For the Sender Information, you will have a few options:
{}Animation 1:{}
Choose a sender from a drop down list.
This will allow you to choose names and the reply email addresses you set while creating users.
{}Animation 2:{}
Or you can enter specified information where you will include a name and reply email that is not already in the application.
When using this option, you want to ensure you have the appropriate permission to use that name and email address.
{}Animation 3:{}
Click save!
{}Delivery Profile{}
A delivery profile defines the “what” aspect of your email send – including<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;2400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />IP address, header, and footer information
{}In Application{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
The Delivery Profile is the “what” aspect of your send and contains delivery information for your messages including the IP address, the header and footer.
To create a delivery profile, click the create button from the toolbar and give it a name.
{}Animation 1:{}
If you purchased at least two private IP addresses, you can select the second IP address in the delivery profile.
For example, you may want to use different IP addresses for your commercial and transactional sends.
{}Animation 2:{}
Your account default header will include a link to view the email as a webpage and the default footer is the data currently in the bottom section of your emails.
There is a choice for none, use that option if you added the header and/or footer in the body of your email, so your account default is not added.
You can also choose library content for a header and or footer you created, just choose that radio button and select a content area saved in the my content folder under emails.
Note:
If you created your email using our html paste option, the default header and footer is not added to those emails, including a delivery profile.
With that option, add your header and footer directly in your email code, as this feature only works with template based emails.
{}CAN-SPAM{}
The CAN-SPAM (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing) Act is the U.S. Federal standards for the sending of email messages.
There are two classifications of emails:
Commercial: the primary purpose is to deliver commercial content.
Must include the physical mailing address and opt-out mechanism
Transactional: primary purpose is to communicate transactional content.
No unsubscribe link required.
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Before we configure the Send Classification, let’s talk about the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, or the CAN-SPAM Act as most of us know it, that is the US federal standards.
There are 2 classifications of emails based on the act:
Commercial emails are when the primary purpose of the message is to deliver commercial content.
Examples include newsletters, weekly specials, upcoming events, etc.
Commercial emails MUST include your physical mailing address and provide an opt-out/unsubscribe mechanism.
Transactional emails are normally initiated by the subscriber.
Examples include order confirmations, shipping notices, thank you emails, etc.
An unsubscribe link is not required in transactional messages.
Remaining in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act is very important as non-compliance can lead to fines, litigation, even imprisonment.
If you are unsure if an email is commercial or transactional, we recommend you include the unsubscribe link though that is not legal advice.
If you do have questions about your emails and CAN-SPAM, we recommend you engage your legal counsel for details specific to your organization.
{}Send Classification{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Now that we’ve created a sender profile and a delivery profile, you are able to configure a send classification.
A send classification allows you to define parameters for email jobs in a central location to save time and effort, mitigate risk and give you greater control of sends in your account.
The send classification will specify the sender profile, delivery profile, and the CAN-SPAM classification.
To create a send classification, click create from the toolbar and
{}Animation 1: {}…Give it a name, but the external key, and description are again optional.
{}Animation 2:{}
Next you will set the CAN-SPAM classification – commercial or transactional.
{}Animation 3:{}
Then identify the appropriate sender and delivery profile that were created in the previous 2 steps.
{}Animation 4:{}
You also have the opportunity to select a send priority and it will set the priority of which the email is sent.
Normal is the default and the email will be sent at a normal pace.
Low will result in the send being given a lower priority and may take longer than normal to complete the send.
High, which may not be enabled in your account, will result in the email send being given priority over other sends in the account.
{}Animation 5:{}
The final step is to save the send classification you’ve created.
{}Live Demonstration:<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" /><size val="3600">{}Creating a Send Classification</size>{}{}
Now let’s take a look at this feature in a live environment, give me just a moment to set this up.
{}BrandBuilder{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 2:{}
The last section we will cover today is the BrandBuilder.
The BrandBuilder is a private labeling tool that allows you to provide a branded experience to both your application users and your subscribers by configuring certain aspects, including:
Adding your logo/header and background color to every screen, including the login screen.
Change the color scheme of the primary navigation buttons.
Brand your survey and Forward to a Friend landing pages as well as the Profile and Subscription Centers.
To begin, navigate to Brand Builder, click on your company name and click Start Now.
Step One will prompt you to upload your organization’s logo,
{}Animation 1:{}
Click Choose File and select your logo, then click Upload Logo.
It will take a moment to process, then be displayed onscreen.
Also note the size guideline for your logo is 550 X 60 pixels or smaller.
{}Animation 2:{}
Then click Next.
{}Animation 3:{}
The application will then present you with color scheme options that match your logo.
You can select one of the options displayed, or create a custom scheme.
<kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{}Animation 4:{}
If you would like to make any modifications to the color scheme, you can do so in Step Three by changing the respective hexadecimal.
If you do not know the hexidecimal value but do know the RBG value, you can enter that into a search engine to find the hexidemcial.
</fill-sd></kern><kern val="0"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:sysClr val=&quot;windowText&quot; lastClr=&quot;000000&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">An important item to check is to make sure the highlight color is not set to white, because the background is white. </fill-sd></kern>
{}BrandBuilder{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Now you will be able to preview the branding to ensure the display is as you intended.
{}Animation 1:{}
Once you have reviewed and are happy with the previews, click next.
{}Animation 2:{}
Your brand is now built in your application!
{}Animation 3:{}
Choose the box by the account name to activate the branding in the account…
{}Animation 4: {}…and click finish!
An important item to note, once a new brand has been applied to the account there is no way to revert to the original or “out of the box” branding.
If you wish to revert changes, contact Global Support at <lnk-c val="&lt;a:hlinkClick r:id=&quot;rId3&quot;/&gt;">{}help@exacttarget.com</lnk-c>{}
{}Live Demonstration:<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" /><size val="3600">{}BrandBuilder</size>{}{}

{}Objectives:{}
{}Adding Subscribers{}
Understand how to import, manage, and segment your subscribers using lists.
We will share proven approaches to help you:
Understand the SUBSCRIBERS RULE philosophy
Create and manage preference & profile attributes
Create a subscriber list and import subscribers
Segmenting your list using Groups
{}Speaker1:{}
By the end of today’s session you will be familiar with the Subscriber Rules philosophy, Profile and Preference Attributes and how to create and manage a subscriber list.
{}Transition to Speaker2 if there is one{}
{}SUBSCRIBERS RULE!{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
We have a lot of information to cover today so let’s get started with the SUBSCRIBERS RULE!
Philosophy, it will help set the groundwork for subscriber management.
{}SUBSCRIBERS RULE!{}
Serve the individual.
Honor their unique preference with regard to communication, <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />content, frequency & channels.
Deliver to them timely, relevant content that improves their lives.
{}Speaker 1:{}
The first step to achieving success with your email marketing is understanding the industry’s best practices.
The SUBSCRIBERS RULE philosophy will help you gain that understanding and start you on the path to success.
It is based on three tenets:
Serve the individual
Honor their unique preferences with regard to communication, content, frequency, and channels.
Deliver timely, relevant content that improves their lives.
Basically, your subscribers come first, so you want to ensure you respect their preferences and deliver relevant content to them with every communication you send.
{}Subscribers{}
{}Speaker 2:{}
Next we will jump into subscribers to go through the process of creating and managing them in your Salesforce Marketing Cloud account.
{}Subscribers Tab{}
To add and manage subscribers, profile and preference attributes and lists, navigate to the subscribers tab.
{}Speaker 2:{}
Our focus for this session will be in the Subscribers tab of the application.
This is where you will create attributes, lists, and manage your subscribers.
Our starting point for subscribers will actually begin outside the application by identifying which Profile and Preference attributes are required for your organization.
You will see some exercises designed to help you determine your profile and preference attributes in your Getting Started workbook.
Our first step in the application will be configuring those profile and preference attributes, then cover how to create a list and add subscribers.
{}Profile and Preference Management{}
Profile and preference management are the two areas under subscribers where your attributes will be created and managed, your subscriber values will be uploaded into them in your imports.
We will now go through the process of creating them.
{}Profile attributes{}
Profile attributes allow you to gather additional data points on your subscribers to drive relevant, personalized communications
{}Speaker 1:{}
Profile attributes allows you to capture your subscribers information and are essentially personal data points.
By default, there are three profile attributes created in your account:
Email Address - which is a require attribute in the account and cannot be removed ,
User defined - is a generic attribute which you may use however you wish, and
Full name - which can be deleted along with the user define attribute if you choose to do so
Now let’s cover how to create profile attributes to help facilitate your communications.
{}Animation 1:{}
To create a new Profile Attribute, first you will navigate to the Subscribers tab in the email application and then click on Profile Management in the dropdown.
It will also be located in the left menu area as well.
{}Animation 2:{}
When you select Profile Management the workspace will display all of the profile attributes which have already been configured in your account.
Now from the toolbar, let’s click Create to begin that process.
{}Create a profile attribute{}
Complete the information on the General tab
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Once the wizard appears, you can then begin creating your attribute by adding the following information.
{}Animation 1:{}
Enter a unique name for the attribute.
{}Animation 2:{}
Next we can enter a description and change the display order of the attribute, though both of these items are optional throughout the account.
{}Animation 3:{}
Now we will set the attributes section; the first option will make the attribute required and this means (every subscriber is required to have a value for it or they will not be imported the account), then we have the hidden field (which means it is only visible in the application to the users, the subscribers will not be able to see it on the profile center landing page), and read only means (the subscribers can see the value but will not be able to modify it).
You can also select {}Do not update subscriber values with send time values; {}When this option is selected, it will not allow your subscriber attribute values to change when an email is triggered to them through an api call.
I normally get questions on this option, so let me know if you have any as well.
{}Create a profile attribute{}
Configure the Data tab
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Next let’s go to the Data tab where you will be able to configure the following:
{}Animation 1:{}
First it’s the Data Type, it can be set to text, date or numeric.
{}Animation 2:{}
Then a default value, which may be a good idea if the profile attribute you are creating will be used for personalization.
When there is no value imported for some subscribers, the default value will be added instead.
{}Animation 3:{}
And if there needs to be a minimum or maximum length set for the attribute it can be done here.
{}Create a profile attribute{}
Specify possible values – this is optional and should be used when you want to limit the possible data points used for an attribute
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
If you would like to restrict the values for any attribute that you create, that can be done under the values tab.
There we click Add to begin that process and name your value.
Continue to add your restricted values until all that are needed are created.
Once they are created, that attribute is now required to have one of them added for each subscriber.
By default, the first restricted value added will also be the default value for this attribute, but that can be changed under the data tab.
The fourth tab in the image is for the Salesforce integration and that feature is covered in a different webinar.
Now let’s save the attribute by clicking the OK button.
{}Create a profile attribute{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1{}
The fourth tab is used to map your attributes to the fields that are already in your Salesforce account.
{}Animation 1:{}
The first drop down allows you to select the Salesforce lead fields that you wish to map to your attributes.
For example if you just created a First Name Attribute you will want to map this to the First Name field.
Click Okay
{}Animation 2:{}
The second drop down allows you to select the Salesforce Contact or Account Fields you wish to map to your attributes.
{}Animation 3:{}
Again in this example we chose First Name.
Click Okay
{}Animation 4:{}
The third step in mapping your attributes is to decide if you want them displayed on your Salesforce Profile Center for Leads and or Contacts.
{}Animation 5:{}
You can check the box next to the one or both of the options depending on if you just want to map the field to a Lead or just a Contact/Account
Click Okay
{}Preference attributes{}
A preference attribute indicates how a subscriber prefers to receive emails and can be used for yes/no scenarios.
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 2:{}
Now let’s talk about preference attributes, they are used to indicate how a subscriber prefers to receive emails and they are based on yes/no logic.
A preference attribute named HTML Email is created in your account by default and it indicates if the subscribers wants to receive an html or text email.
Additional preference attributes can be created for communication opt-in, content preference, etc.
The process to create a Preference Attribute is similar to creating a profile attribute.
So let’s choose Preference Management in the left menu and click create to begin that process.
{}Create a preference attribute{}
Complete fields under the General tab.
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 2:{}
Like for profile attributes, we will begin by giving our preference attribute a name:
{}Animation 1:{}
Once the name is added,
{}Animation 2:{}
We can add a description and or change the display order, though both again are optional.
{}Animation 3:{}
The default value can be set to either Yes or No. If you are managing email subscriptions using Preference Attributes, it is recommended that you set the value to no to ensure subscribers have selected yes to receive the communications.
{}Animation 4:{}
Preference attributes can also be set to read only, hidden and to not update subscriber values with send time values.
Note; The profile and preference attributes can also be used to segment your lists
{}Managing Profile Attributes{}
Modify existing profile attributes.
Delete profile attributes.
Preview Profile Center.
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 2:{}
Now that we have profile and preference attributes created, we can manage them as well, including modifying existing attributes and deleting attributes that are no longer needed.
We have the same options available for both attribute types.
You can modify existing attributes by clicking on the Attribute Name to access and update the properties.
If an attribute is no longer required, you can delete it by toggling the box next to the attribute name and clicking Delete in the toolbar.
Keep in mind though, that when attributes are deleted, any values uploaded for them will also be deleted.
Finally, we can preview the Profile Center by clicking on the Profile Center link.
{}Profile Center{}
Subscribers can manage their attributes and preferences using Profile Center.
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 2:{}
The preview is a great tool to see how the Profile Center appears to your subscribers and identify if any changes in the attribute names, order or visibility needs to be made.
A link to the Profile Center is included in the footer of your emails by default which allows subscribers to access this landing page.
It also provides access to the Subscription Center which allows them to manage the communications they receive from your organization.
That link is also included in your email footer by default.
{}Live Demonstration:<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" /><size val="3600">{}Creating Profile and Preference Attributes</size>{}{}
Now let’s take a look at this feature in a live environment, give me just a moment to set this up.
Please add your questions to the question widget, Phil will let me know what your questions are as I get the demo ready.
{}List{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Now that the Profile and Preference Attributes have been configured, let’s create a list to upload your subscribers data into.
{}Create a List{}
A list is a compilation of subscribers that receive your communications.
Multiple lists can be created to segment subscribers to target  your email communications.
{}Speaker 1:{}
A list is a collection of subscriber data that your communications are sent to.
You can create multiple lists in your account to segment subscribers for specific email communications – for example you can create lists for sending your monthly newsletter or weekly specials.
Something to think about while setting up lists is how to manage your communications and there is an exercise in your workbook designed to help you do that!
One great feature when creating a list is the choice to make it public – this provides visibility to the subscriber via the Subscription Center landing page.
As they are able to add themselves to any public list.
After the list is created, we are then able to add subscribers to it.
Let’s walk through the process of creating a list….
First navigate to my subscribers in the left men and choose the plus sign by my subscribers.
{}Animation 1: {}then choose my lists
{}Animation 2: {}and click Create
{}Create a List{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
After clicking create, the list properties box will display
{}Animation 1:{}
The list requires a name, which will identify the list in the email send wizard.
{}Animation  2:{}
You can make the list Public if you would like your subscribers to be able to subscribe or unsubscribe themselves from them.
Note:
If you make the list public, both the name and the description will be visible in the subscription center.
{}Animation 3:{}
External key and description are both optional
{}Animation 4:{}
You can specify a different location you would like to save your list to.
{}Animation 5:{}
And the final item is to associate your list with a campaign if desired, but this is an optional choice.
Once all choices have been made, click next to access the second page.
{}Create a List{}
Select if you would like to send a welcome email.
Default value is ‘Do not send welcome email.’
Welcome email is only sent via web-collect or subscription center.
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
On the next page you can select whether you would like to send a welcome email to newly added subscribes.
If you choose to ‘send a welcome email’ you will need to select an email that you created in the account.
This feature activates each time a new subscriber joins the list either when added through the subscription center page or when the Marketing Cloud web collect code is used on your company’s website.
The final step is to click save!
{}List Management{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Once your list is created you will be able to manage certain aspects of the list within the list workspace.
On the properties tab you’ll be able to:
{}Animation 1:{}
Update the name
{}Animation 2:{}
Change or copy the external key.
The external key is used by developers in API calls to access the list programmatically.
{}Animation 3:{}
Modify the list settings to be public or private
{}Animation 4:{}
Quickly view how many subscribers are in your list and
{}Animation 5:{}
Manage the welcome email settings.
{}List Management{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Now if we go to the tracking tab, you will be able to quickly see the health of your list by checking on the status of your subscribers.
{}Animation 1:{}
You will also see any sends to the list for the last 30 days.
{}Live Demonstration:<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" /><size val="3600">{}Creating a List</size>{}{}
Now let’s take a look at this feature in a live environment, give me just a moment to set this up.
While I am setting this up, please add any questions in the widget, Phil will be checking for them.
{}Adding Subscribers{}
{}Speaker 2:{}
Now that the list has been created, we can add subscribers to it!
{}Adding Subscribers to a List{}
There are two ways to add a subscriber to a list in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud email application:
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;63932D&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Manually:</fill-sd> add one subscriber at a time using the Create Subscriber Wizard.
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;63932D&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Import:</fill-sd> add multiple subscribers at once using the Import option.
{}Speaker 2:{}
There are two options for adding subscribers:
1.
You can manually add a subscriber using the Create Subscriber Wizard.
2.
Or you can Import Subscribers into a List which allows you add many subscribers at once.
Now let’s walk through the process of adding subscribers using both options.
{}Add Subscribers to a List - Manually{}
Select the list you wish to add a subscriber by<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />clicking the hyperlinked list name and click Create <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />in the toolbar.
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 2:{}
Let’s first see how to manually add a subscriber.
{}Animation 1:{}
Choose the list the subscriber will be added to,
{}Animation 2:{}
Then click Create in the toolbar.
{}Add Subscribers to a List - Manually{}
Follow the wizard to create your subscriber
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 2:{}
{}Animation 1:{}
Once the wizard opens, click next
{}Animation 2:{}
Now you can enter the subscriber’s email address.
If your organization has enabled subscriber key, you may enter  your own unique value or the subscribers email address.
The other attributes may also be entered on this screen as well.
Now a little note on subscriber key:
By default, email address is the unique identifier for the subscriber and an email address can only exist once in each list.
However, this will prevent multiple people from using the same email address if needed – subscriber key is the solution to this issue as once enable it becomes the unique identifier in the account.
{}Animation 3:{}
Click next
{}Add Subscribers to a List – Manually{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Animation 1:{}
Here you can select additional lists you would like to add the subscriber to, and click Finish.
{}Animation 2:{}
You will now see confirmation that you are complete.
You can choose to create another subscriber, or click Finish to exit the wizard.
{}Adding Subscribers to a List – Import{}
Select the list you wish to add subscribers to by
Clicking the hyperlinked list name, or
Choosing the Import button under {}Actions{}
If you click the hyperlinked name, <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />click Import in the toolbar in the Subscriber Tab.
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Adding numerous subscribers at once can be accomplished by choosing import in the actions area.
{}Animation 1:{}
Or you can click on the list name and then the import button in the tools area.
{}Add Subscribers to a List – Import{}
Follow the Import Subscriber wizards to add subscribers to your list
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
This will open the Import Subscribers Wizard.
Click next on the first page to begin.
{}Animation 1:{}
The second screen in the wizard is going to prompt you to confirm the subscribers you are importing have opted-in to receive your communications.
This goes back to the SUBSCRIBERS RULE philosophy – you will receive the most success communicating with subscribers who have engaged with your brand and have chosen to receive your messages.
{}Animation 2:{}
Once you have certified your list is permission-based, click ‘I agree’ and then the next button.
{}Add Subscribers to a List – Import{}
Data Formats:
CSV
Tab Delimited
Other Delimited
Update Options:
Add and update.
Add only.
Update only.
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Now you will select your file to import – this may be selected from your local computer, or it may be retrieved from the FTP server.
Ensure you specify the appropriate Data Format, these are the three options:
1.
CSV
2.
Tab Delimited or
3.
Other Delimited, where the delimiter can be pipes or another of your choosing
Finally you have the update options – your selection here may vary depending on if it is new list or a list you are updating.
Your options include:
1.
Add new subscribers and update subscribers who already exist; which will both add and update your subscribers.
This option is most suitable for the majority of your import scenarios.
2.
Add new subscribers but do not update subscribers who already exist; will only add new subscribers – existing subscribers will not be modified.
3.
Update existing subscribers but do not add subscribers that do not exist; it will only update subscribers who are already present in the list and will not import new subscribers.
{}Add Subscribers to a List – Import{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
The next step is where the attributes are mapped.
{}Animation 1:{}
Headers with an exact name match to an attribute will automatically map to them and those that do not match exactly can be manually mapped to the attributes.
In order to manually map them, choose the source or header name from the file you are importing and then the destination file or attribute, once both are highlighted, click map.
You can unmap your attributes as well by choosing the attribute and clicking unmap.
Keep in mind that any field that is not mapped, will not be imported.
{}Animation 2:{}
Finally, we will select if we would like to receive an email notification when the import is completed, and this can be handy when importing large files.
Enter an email address to receive the notification, click begin and the import will start.
{}Add Subscribers to a List - Import{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
A Progress bar will be displayed while the file imports, but if an email address was added on the previous page, there will be a notification that states that the import has begun.
A notification will be displayed when the import is completed or you will receive an email if you entered your email address.
Now choose “Take me to my list” then click finish and the workplace will automatically refresh to display the subscribers you imported!
{}Live Demonstration:<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" /><size val="3600">{}Importing a List</size>{}{}
Now let’s take a look at this feature in a live environment, give me just a moment to set this up.
Add your questions in the widget during this time and Phil will be checking for them.
{}Groups{}
Now that we have subscribers in lists, let’s discuss how you can further segment your lists to drive relevant communications.
{}What is a Group?{}
A group is a subset of subscribers from a list (or another group).
Allows you to make targeted lists of subscribers at random or based on specific criteria.
Speaker 1:
<size val="2400"><kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><eff-l val="&lt;a:effectLst/&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-lt&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">Groups are a subset of subscribers they allow you to create a targeted selection of subscribers based on random or specified criteria.
Groups can be created from lists, or even other groups within the application.</font></eff-l></fill-sd></kern></size>
{}Group Creation Options{}
There are two methods to create a group.
Filtered:
Create a group based on criteria about the subscriber.
Random:
Create a group with subscribers either randomly selected or selected at a fixed interval.
Speaker 1:
There are two methods of group creation:
Filtered groups allows you to build a rule that is based on profile and preferences attributes.
Filtered groups also allow you to build groups based on a data filter, which uses the same creation method as a filter.
We are not coving data filters today, however you can get further information on data filters at help.exacttarget.com.
Random groups allow you to pick a random group of subscribers by specifying the number of subscribers or percentage of the list that should be used.
You can also create a random group using a fixed interval that allows you to specify the number of subscribers you want in your group and at what interval they should be chosen.
You can create up to 12 groups for each list or group in the application, and up to 12 groups can be created at once using certain methods.
The method you choose will vary depending on the intention for the group.
For example, are you creating groups for segmentation?
If you are, a filtered group is likely the group you’d use.
Are you creating the group for testing?
If yes, you’ll likely create a group using the random method.
Let take a better look at each of these methods…
{}Filtered Group Creation{}
Speaker 1:
To create a filtered group navigate to My Groups and
{}Animation 1: {}click Create.
{}Animation 2:{}
Choose the Filtered Group option.
{}Animation 3:{}
Next, you will indicate the source the group will be derived from.
This will be the list that will provide the population from which your group is created.
You can pick either a list you’ve created in your account, the All Subscribers list that holds all subscribers in your account, or another group.
{}Filtered Group Creation{}
Speaker 1:
Next you will select the Profile or Preference attributes and set values.
{}Animation 1:{}
Here you can drag and drop attributes onto the Create Filter Canvas and configure each attribute to the conditions you need for your group creation.
{}Animation 2:{}
In the drop down, you will see that the email application has quite a few predefined functions that you can use when creating your group.
{}Animation 3:{}
You can also change the and/or operators by hovering over the bottom of the or/and box and drag it up or down according to the range you would like to cover.
{}Animation 4:{}
When you have all your conditions set, click save & build.
{}Animation 5:{}
The final step is to provide a name for your group, a description if needed, and determine the location you would like your group to be saved in.
By default, the group will be saved in the My Groups folder.
Once you click save, the email application will build your group!
{}Live Demonstration:<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" /><size val="3600">{}Creating a Filtered Group</size>{}{}
Now let’s take a look at this feature in a live environment, give me just a moment to set this up.
Please let us know if you have any questions during this time.
{}Random Group Creation{}
Speaker 1:
To create a random group, we will complete the same initial steps as we did for the Filtered Group.
{}Animation 1:{}
You will navigate to My Groups and{} {}click Create.
{}Animation 2:{}
This time we will select the random group option in step 2.
{}Animation 3:{}
Next, you will indicate the source the group will be derived from.
Once again, this will be the list that will provide the population from which your group is created.
You can pick either a list you’ve created in your account, the All Subscribers list that holds all subscribers in your account, or another group.
{}Random Group Creation{}
{}Animation 3:{}
Now lets indicate the source the group will be derived from.
Once again, this will be the list that will provide the population from which your group is created.
You can pick a list you’ve created in your account, the All Subscribers list, or another group.
{}Random Group Creation{}
Speaker 1:
On the next screen,
{}Animation 1:{}
Click the “Add Group” button to begin the process.
{}Animation 2:{}
You can now specify a group name, the size of the group in percentage or number of subscribers, and specify a Location if different than My Groups.
You can repeat this process up to 12 times for a single list.
{}Animation 3:{}
Click Save and Build
{}Live Demonstration:<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" /><size val="3600">{}Creating a Random Group</size>{}{}
Now let’s take a look at this feature in a live environment, give me just a moment to set this up.
During this time ask your questions as I begin the demo.
{}Creating a Report or Campaign <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />in Salesforce{}
A Report or Campaign is the list comparison in Salesforce, let’s see how to create them in Salesforce
{}Creating a Report{}
First log into Salesforce.com using your integrated user credentials.
Then select the Report Tab..
{}Animation 1:{}
And select New Report
{}Animation 2:{}
This brings you to a page where you can select your report type
{}Animation 3: {}select an object from which you will build a report such as leads or accounts & contacts
{}Animation 4:{}
Click Create
{}Animation 5{}:
Here you save your report
{}Animation 6:{}
Enter a name for your report and a unique name will auto fill
{}Animation 7:{}
Select the Marketing Cloud Admin Report Folder and click save
{}Filtering a Report{}
This will take you to an editing page where you can filter your report to pull up the leads or contacts you wish to include in your “list” of subscribers to send to.
{}Animation 1:{}
You can drag Fields from the left panel onto columns to add them to the report.
You must include the Contact ID as a column in your report in order for your send to be successful.
Other than that feel free to add any other fields to your report.
{}Animation 2:{}
Click Run Report
{}Animation 3:{}
And you can see which objects have been included based on the filter you just created.
You will use these reports and lists when we begin to build and send our email!

Discover how to create, build and store branded templates directly in the Email application and how to create engaging emails.
We will share proven approaches to help you:
Understand how to leverage Portfolio
Create a template using the template editor or paste HTML
Create an email using various creation options
{}Speaker1:{}
After today’s session you will be equipped to create an email, use Portfolio to store your various assets, build and brand templates, and create an email using various content creation options.
Let’s get started!
{}Transition to Speaker2 if there is one{}
SCREEN SHOT OF EMAIL THAT WILL BE BUILT IN TODAY’S SESSION
{}Do you have an email already that you’d like to build in this session or is that something we need to determine?{}
Today’s session will be focused on the steps necessary to build an email in the Email application – just like the one on this slide!
We have a lot to cover today, so let’s get started!
{}Portfolio{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Our first area of focus will be on Portfolio, which is our first step in preparation to create our email.
{}Portfolio{}
Manage your email send assets online, including images, documents, and media files.
{}Speaker 1:{}
What is Portfolio?
Portfolio allows you to manage your email assets online.
You can store a wide variety of files in Portfolio including images, documents, and media files to be used in an email.
All common file types are supported for images & graphics, documents, text, office files, and audio & video files.
Images uploaded to Portfolio can be up to 200KB each – this size should be sufficient for your image uploads as they will be resized for inclusion in your email.
All other file types – i.e. documents, multimedia – can be up to 1MB each.
If you ever encounter an issue with the size limitation or require an item to be added which exceeds the sizes noted, please contact Global Support for assistance.
File names must be at least 5 characters long as well.
{}Portfolio Upload Options{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
There are 2 options for uploading items into Portfolio.
Single Upload and
Batch upload
Lets take a closer look at the steps for each of these options….
{}Animation 1:{}
Clicking the single upload option from the Portfolio navigation bar will begin the process…..
{}Animation 2:{}
The wizard will open to allow you to upload a file.
Choose your file by first clicking the browse button.
Once the file is chosen, give it a unique file name, though the external key and description are optional.
Click Ok to start the uploading process.
{}Animation 3:{}
Clicking the batch upload option will allow you to upload multiple files at the same time.
Those files are also required to be in a zipped folder first.
{}Animation 4:{}
The wizard opens to begin that process.
Just as with the single option, you will click browse and select the zipped folder you want to upload into Portfolio.
If you accidentally added a file to that folder you don’t want uploaded into Portfolio, you have the opportunity to erase it by clicking the Remove hyperlink before uploading your files.
Just as with the single option, click Ok to begin the upload process.
Batch upload is a great option if you have a lot of files to import at once.
{}Portfolio Management{}
Portfolio Items can be deleted, moved to another folder, properties reviewed/updated, and previewed.
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Once you have your portfolio items uploaded in the application they can be easily managed.
Any item no longer required can be removed by selecting the item(s) and clicking delete.
If you need to move an item to another folder, choose that file and click move.
A select folder dialogue box will open allowing you to pick the appropriate folder.
Item properties can be viewed or modified at any time as well – simply select the item and click properties.
Here are some general recommendations to help you get the most out of Portfolio.
Leverage folders to organize your Portfolio items.
You can create folders for different emails, campaigns, item type and so on, to suit your preferences.
There is an exercise in your Workbook to outline a folder structure that will work best for you.
Ensure each file has a unique name when they share the same extension and a unique external key.
When an item is uploaded, by default, the file name minus the file extension will be the name of the file.
You can upload a file with the same name and different extension, but the external key is required to be unique.
Duplicate file names with the same extension or external keys will cause an error during the upload process, just change the name or external key to fix that issue.
Optimize images by resizing them to the desired pixel width and height prior to uploading them into Portfolio.
While you can resize images within Portfolio, you’ll have the best results using an image editor like adobe to resize them before the upload.
Also, as a best practice – images being used as a header in an email should be 600 X 150 pixels, as that is the exact size of the template header area.
{}Templates{}
{}Speaker 2:{}
We begin to use our portfolio items in the next step – which is creating Templates.
Templates are used to control the header, background color, borders, and content layout of an email.
They allow you to brand your email and create consistent layouts for your subscribers.
There are a number of advantages of using templates including consistency in branding and layouts.
Templates make it easy for non-technical users to create emails, and the templates themselves.
Content creation and template creation can be completed by 2 different users – i.e. a graphic designer manages the templates and a copywriter populates content in the email.
{}Creating Templates{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 2:{}
To access templates, navigate to “my templates” within the content tab of the Email Application.
There are 2 options to create a template – using the template editor and pasting in your own HTML.
The template editor allows you to pick from 13 mobile optimized layouts and 7 static predefined layouts that can be used without any indebt technical knowledge of creating emails.
Paste HTML allows you to take advantage of the power of customized HTML coding while providing users with a graphical user interface and content boxes it can be used in.
We’ll take a look at the steps required for both options.
First we’ll walk through creating a template using the Template editor.
{}Animation 1:{}
Your first step is to navigate to the template folder under My Content in the Email application and click create.
{}Animation 2:{}
On the next screen, you will enter a name for your template and you can choose to select a different folder to place the template in.
By default, the template will be placed in the My Templates folder.
Finally, the default Template Source is “User Template Editor”, we will leave that radio button selected and click save in the toolbar.
{}Template Editor{}
The template editor will guide you through how you can make the template consistent with your brand’s look and feel.
Best Practice: headers should be image only (maximum width 600 pixels).
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 2:{}
Our template has now been created and notice it is a blank template.
The template editor allows you to modify the template by creating a header, changing the layout, border width and color, as well as the background color.
{}Animation 1:{}
When you click the Create Header button you will be prompted to choose a smart orientation.
{}Animation 2:{}
For today’s demonstration we will be selecting image only and leveraging an image we have uploaded to Portfolio or one that can be uploaded right away.
You will then be prompted to select an image from portfolio (Remember, the recommended dimensions are 600x150 pixels to optimize the display for subscribers.), or load one to use right away.
If your header image size is outside of the recommended dimensions, right click on the image after it is loaded into the banner and click image properties to change the image size.
Then save the Header which will take us back to the Template Editor screen where we will see the header displayed.
{}Template Editor{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 2:{}
The Template Editor provides us with 13 mobile optimized and 7 static layout options  to choose from.
{}Animation 1:{}
Changing the layout is very easy, click the change link besides Layout A and it will open the dialog box to choose a different layout.
{}Animation 2:{}
Preview the layout options and select the Layout which is best suited for your email and click ok.
Your template will update to reflect the change in layout.
If you choose a layout with many content boxes but do not use all in your email, the empty content boxes will collapse during the sending process and are not displayed.
{}Template Editor{}
{}Speaker 2:{}
The final step in personalizing our template is setting our border characteristics, including border width and color, the border width can be between 1 and 5 pixels.
For setting the border color, you can either select a color from the dropdown or you can enter the hexadecimal values.
You have the same color opportunities for setting the background color if one is desired.
We have just created a template that can now be used to create emails!
{}Live Demonstration:<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" /><size val="3600">{}Creating a Template Using the Editor</size>{}{}
Now I will show you how this feature works in a live environment, so give me just a moment to set that up.
{}Paste HTML Template{}
Create the HTML in a third party editor.
Copy & Paste the HTML code into Marketing Cloud
Preview/Test template as needed.
Insert the email open tracking and Save.
{}Speaker 1:{}
You can also create your template by pasting your own HTML into the application.
If you are going to use this option there are a few things to remember:
You can create the HTML using the HTML editor of your choice, such as Dreamweaver or Notepad
There are a few items you may need to included in your code
The Email open tracking code – Needed to get your opens in tracking
Code to create content areas – For easy editing in the email and to add a marketing cloud survey
Tracking alias for links – Which will be the name of the link in tracking
CAN-SPAM compliance components – This is optional according to your account setup, ie, you requested changes in your default footer
Personalization strings – Also optional, only add them if needed
{}Code to Include in Paste HTML Template{}
Email Open Tracking Code
{}<custom name = "opencounter" type = "tracking">{}
Content Area Code
{}<custom type="content" name="[Content Name]">{}
Tracking Alias
{}<a href = “http://www.salesforce.com/marketing-cloud/overview/” alias = “Salesforce Marketing Cloud Homepage Header”>{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
I want to spend a few minutes providing some more information on the additional code that we just spoke about;
{}Email Open Tracking Code:{}
The email open tracking code is what allows you to track opens within the Salesforce Marketing Cloud.
The code shown on the screen inserts a 1x1 transparent GIF that when images are enabled, the open is captured.
For best results, place the email open tracking code at the top or bottom outside of your <body> tags, because certain email clients will not render all images in an email until the subscriber scrolls.
If the email open tracking code is not included in your code, the Salesforce Marketing Cloud will warn you that it is missing when saving your template.
And if the email is sent without the code, the opens are not able to be captured.
{}Content Area Code:{}
The content area code provides editable regions within the email that users can populate with images, text, or both during the email creation process.
It is also required if you plan to add a Marking Cloud survey in your email, as they are in form format.
It is recommended that you include content areas within a <td> or <tr> tag and important to note that each content area requires a unique name, which can be used to provide guidance on what type of content should be included within the content area.
For example, we see many customers give content areas names like Hero Image, Header, Preheader, Main Article or Body.
{}Tracking Alias:{}
If you are going to be including the same link in multiple places within an email, you will want to provide an alias for tracking purposes.
We will cover tracking more in-depth in a future session, but click tracking is done at the alias level within the application.
By using an alias, you will be able to differentiate between the subscribers that clicked each link, when the same link is used in the email.
Tracking aliases also make it easier to read the tracking overview when using a descriptive alias, for example, using Salesforce Marketing Cloud  Header vs. using just Salesforce Marketing Cloud.
Another important item to note is when an alias isn’t provided, the alias will default to the URL.
If the same URL is in numerous places, you will lose the visibility into which of the links got the most click activity within tracking.
{}Paste HTML Template{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Now let’s look at how we can create a Template using the Paste HTML option in the Email application.
{}Animation 1:{}
Like the previous choice, let’s give it a name and then select ‘Paste HTML’ for your Template Source
{}Animation 2:{}
Now let’s choose Save.
{}Animation 3:{}
After clicking save, paste the HTML code into the workspace provided, this is also where the additional code will be added.
{}Animation 4:{}
Note that it has to be saved before it can be previewed, so click save once the editing is completed.
{}Paste HTML Template{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Once our HTML Template has been saved, we can preview it to ensure it is displaying as intended.
Choose the template by clicking it’s name and selecting the PREVIEW tab.
If you need to make any changes to your HTML, you can navigate back the HTML tab and make any required modifications.
Once you’ve created your template, test it to ensure it is rendering as you expected!
If you have tools such as Litmus or Return Path available to you, they can help you understand how the template is rendering across numerous email clients and browsers at once.
{}Live Demonstration:<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" /><size val="3600">{}Creating a Template Pasting HTML</size>{}{}
Now let’s take a look at this feature in a live environment, give me just a moment to set this up.
{}Template Management{}
Templates can be modified, copied, moved and deleted.
Making a copy of a template allows you to keep the original template as is, but make necessary modifications for other communication needs.
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Regardless of how the Template was created, you will be able to manage them in my templates.
We can:
Modify/update the template as needed by clicking the Template Name
Remove the Template by toggling the check box next to it and select delete (you will be prompted to confirm its deletion).
Move the template to a different folder – this is handy if you created folders under my templates to organize your Templates by topic, campaign, etc.
View and modify the properties
Duplicate a Template by selecting it and clicking Save Copy – which is a great option when you have an original which is still required but modifications for different communications are needed.
{}Creating an Email{}
<size val="2400">{}Speaker 2:{}
Now that we are familiar with how to utilize portfolio and have created templates in the account, the next step is to create an email!
</size><size val="2000">There are many ways of creating an email in the Marketing Cloud, but for this session you will learn how to create an email in the Content tab under ‘my emails’.
The ‘my emails’ area allows you create an email using one of three options – build an email from an existing template, build a new email from HTML and build a new email from text.
You can also create an email from an existing one by doing a copy of a currently created email, but for this session, we will focus on the Build New Email from Existing Template and the Paste HTML option. </size>
{}Creating an email from Existing Template{}
IN APPLICATION
To start, lets navigate to ‘my emails’ in the Content section and click the Create button on the toolbar.
In the dropdown, lets select template based and it opens the following box;
<size val="2200"><kern val="0"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:sysClr val=&quot;windowText&quot; lastClr=&quot;000000&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{}Animation 1:{}
Our next step is to pick the template we want to use.
</fill-sd></kern></size><size val="2000"><kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Click the Select button on the right side of the template field to open the Select Template dialogue box. </fill-sd></kern></size>
{}Animation 2:{}
You now have the option to pick from the templates that were built in the my templates folder.
Select the Template and click OK.
{}Creating an email from an Existing Template{}
IN APPLICATION
{}Animation 1:{}
Next enter an Email Name to identify your email within the application – this value will not be visible to your subscribers.
{}Animation 2:{}
Then enter the subject line of the email which it is one of the first things the subscriber sees when they receive the email and the subject line can be modified later if needed.
Personalization is also available in the subject line and we will cover that more in a few minutes.
{}Animation 3:{}
Add a preheader if needed, but it is optional.
The preheader will display after the subject line on a mobile device.
{}Animation 4:{}
The email can be saved to a different location under ‘my emails’ and those locations will be any new folders that were created in that section.
Note there is an option available here to associate the email to a Campaign – you can learn more about Campaigns on help.exacttarget.com and it was covered in the first webinar of this series.
{}Animation 5:{}
Once those choices have been made, clicking Save will save the properties and take us to the editor.
Now we are able to view the email template and content areas to be populated.
{}Adding Content{}
IN APPLICATION
Now that we’ve created the shell of the email, we need to add content!
To begin that process, click a Content Box and select Create Content
{}Adding Content – Smart Orientation{}
IN APPLICATION
This will open the Content Building Wizard.
The first step in the wizard is to select a Smart Orientation which allows you to easily configure the content area.
There are eight options here, most are self-explanatory:
Text Only or Image Only will only support the option selected
You can select an orientation with both text and image that has the image confined to a specific location within the content area – top, bottom, left or right.
Free form is the most flexible option allowing you to add images, text and tables to the Content area.
By using this option you can add multiple images to your content box, text where ever you like and even custom html.
The final option is HTML Only.
If you intend to paste custom HTML created outside the application and edit it in html only mode, then this is the best option.
{}Adding Content{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
Today, I have chosen the Free Form smart orientation since it allows the most freedom.
The content editor will pop-up and you are able to begin building out your content for the email!
{}Animation 1:{}
The main workspace of the editor is where you will create your content!
Since I am using the free form smart orientation, I am able to add as many images as I would like in one content area and tables to help ensure the layout within the content area meets my needs.
{}Animation 2:{}
You will also notice that you have many options available to help ensure your brand’s look and feel is consistent.
In the toolbar, you’ll find icons that will allow you to set the font characteristics like any other text editor, you can also add bulleted or number lists from the toolbar.
{}Animation 3:{}
An image that has been uploaded into Portfolio, can now be easily added in the content area.
You can also quickly upload a new image as well to use right away.
{}Animation 4:{}
You can add symbols you need to include by clicking the symbol icon.
{}Animation 5:{}
Another handy option available to you is the spell check feature.
By clicking this button, the Email application will run a spell check on your content area and inform you if there are any misspelled words, similar to the feature in the Word text editor.
{}Personalization{}
To add to a content area select the Personalization drop down and select an attribute.
To add to the email subject click the Personalization icon and select the attribute.
IN APPLICATION
Subject lines and Content areas that include text can include personalization.
Personalization allows you to create customized content for your subscriber based on attributes populated in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud or your instance of Salesforce.com if you are using the Marketing Cloud Connector–attributes were covered in the adding subscribers webinar.
For some context, you can use personalization to include the subscriber’s first name in an email, so it is personalize for each subscriber.
To add personalization to the text of a content area, first place the cursor where you would like the field to be added, then click the Personalization drop down and select the attribute to include.
This will populate that personalization string where you have indicated in the text.
You can also add personalization to an email subject line by selecting the personalization icon next to the subject field.
Again, we will select the attribute to add.
Personalization can also be typed directly into the email subject line or content area by including two sets of percentage signs around the attribute, for example,  %%First_Name%%.
A few important items to note when it comes to personalization:
Personalization strings are space sensitive.
Always remember to include a space before and after the string if needed.
If a value for the attribute is empty, a null or blank value will appear in the email.
Ensure a default value is used for attributes to avoid this, such as ‘Valued Customer’ for first name.
{}Links{}
IN APPLICATION
Another common practice is to include links in your email.
There are many ways links can be used – we can link to additional information to keep our email concise, link to landing pages or microsites for subscribers to complete Smart Capture forms, and there are other opportunities for links as well.
Inserting links is simple, just highlight the text or image you would like to link to and
{}Animation 1:{}
Choose hyperlink from the Insert dropdown.
{}Animation 2:{}
Or you can click on the hyperlink icon as well.
<size val="2400">{}Animation 3:{}
E</size><size val="2000">ither option will open the Insert Link wizard.
In the Link To field you can leave the default of website and enter a URL to link to.
Or if you click the dropdown by website, you can choose one of the other options.
For now we will focus on linking to a website so you will want to enter the URL to link to.
Below the URL field there could be an option for Conversion Tracking List, it is not available in all accounts.
Conversion tracking allows you to track the number of click throughs for a link and even compare performance on links in an email.
To activate conversion tracking, check this option.</size>
In the Link Display area, we have two fields which will both default to the highlighted text.
First, the Link Tooltip, which is also optional – it will display when a subscriber hovers over the link.
You may choose to modify this to something more descriptive – such as the actual webpage name or a call to action, like Complete loyalty profile
The second field is the Tracking Alias which is a required field – use this field to specify the link name for tracking.
You may include the same link multiple times in an email, such as a link to your company’s website.
By default, tracking will aggregate all of those clicks into one, which is great for getting an overall number.
But if you would like the performance of each link separately, assign each link a unique tracking alias.
{}Live Demonstration:<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" /><size val="3600">{}Creating a Template Based Email</size>{}{}
Now let’s take a look at this feature in a live environment, give me just a moment to set this up.
{}Creating an email using HTML Paste{}
IN APPLICATION
You also have the option of creating an HTML paste email.
If you choose this option, you will not use the templates available in your account but will instead use HTML code.
You can either create HTML code directly in the application or paste HTML from an external editor.
To create an email this way you will go to the Create button in the My Emails toolbar and select HTML Paste.
{}Animation 1:{}
You will then be on the properties page for your email where you will provide a name for it – remember this isn’t visible to subscribers.
Though the subject line for the email is, also the preheader if one is being used and select the location you wish to store the email.
The fields should look familiar as they are the same options when creating an email from a template.
{}Animation 2:{}
Once you complete your choices, clicking Save will save the properties and take us to the editor were we are able to view the paste html template.
{}Creating an email using HTML Paste{}
The next screen is where you can either create your HTML code within the workspace or copy and paste the HTML code from an external editor into the application.
When working with emails created with HTML code, you may need to insert certain items that are required by the federal CAN-SPAM Act.
For emails built using a standard template, these items are automatically embedded into the email.
{}Physical mailing address{}:
All commercial email must contain a physical mailing address.
You need to insert your physical mailing address using the email tools provided; it cannot be typed directly into the email.
{}Link to unsubscribe or modify profile{}:
All commercial email must contain a valid opt-out mechanism.
To meet this requirement, you can embed a link in your emails by which you can unsubscribe from your communications.
In addition, you can also give your subscribers the ability to update their profile information.
Make sure the images are uploaded in your <lnk-c val="&lt;a:hlinkClick r:id=&quot;rId3&quot; tooltip=&quot;/link/a2a08f2c6acf4a26a398bd84944d8461.aspx?id=6454&amp;amp;epslanguage=en&quot;/&gt;">Portfolio</lnk-c> folder or your company server before you create your email, as the url for them are needed to use in the code.
Also check the URLs in the email code to make sure they correspond properly.
{}Animation 1:{}
Though you are using the HTML option, you can add these items into the HTML code of your emails as desired:
Personalization strings using the attributes in your account
The Email Tools drop down include items that are included when creating an email using a template.
Options include CAN-SPAM items, view as a webpage links, and forward to a friend links.
An advanced option for rich media, such as Flash or QuickTime integrations can be chosen
You can also include the code for tracking email opens from the tracking drop down.
{}Live Demonstration:<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" /><size val="3600">{}Creating a HTML Paste Email</size>{}{}
Now let’s take a look at this feature in a live environment, give me just a moment to set this up.
{}Creating Email from Salesforce{}
Email creation can be accessed through Salesforce after installation and configuration of both your Marketing Cloud and Salesforce account.
From the Email Sends Tab where you would normally select an existing email,
{}Animation 1 {}..
You can also select New and this takes you to the Marketing Cloud where you can begin the Create New Email process as we just discussed.

{}Content Detective{}
Content Detective helps you identify potential spam triggers in your email content
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Spearker2: (if two speakers){}
The first tool you can use is Content Detective.
This feature mirrors the logic used by spam-filtering software to identify words, phrases, image sizes and patterns that are likely to trigger filters and recommends changing the issue it fines.
If one trigger is found in your email, generally it will probably not affect deliverability.
Though it is always a great ideal to make the change because the email service providers periodically change their spam software and that word could generate a higher spam score.
However, when two or more are found it is recommended you edit your content as suggested by content detective to reduce the likelihood of the email being filtered as spam.
Content detective will not force you to make those changes, but you are taking a risk on deliverability if you do not.
To run this check, click Content Detective from the toolbar.
It will scan the entire email, including the links and their properties and any custom coding that were added.
{}Content Detective{}
Any triggers found will be listed on the results screen
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Spearker2: (if two speakers){}
If any triggers are found, both the problem and a suggested resolution will be displayed.
On the results screen you can print or save the results which is handy if someone else is responsible for the content and you are verifying prior to sending.
{}Animation 1:{}
You can edit the email to fix any problems identified by clicking the edit button.
Tip:
If it finds a word you are not able to find in the body of the email, check your link properties and or go to the html tab to check for it there.
{}Validate{}
Validating your email will check your for common issues that could prevent your email from being sent.
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Spearker2: (if two speakers){}
Next, you will want to validate your email which will scan the email for common issues that could prevent your email from being sent.
Using validation will help improve your delivery rate and help ensure the send appears to your subscribers as you intend.
It will check for:
CAN-SPAM compliance (i.e. the presence of an unsubscribe link and presence of a physical mailing address, two items that are required for commercial emails)
It will also check for correct syntax for the attribute personalization strings used in the email.
Validating your email is easy.
{}Animation 1:{}
In the email workspace, click Validate from the toolbar.
{}Animation 2:{}
Select subscriber lists or groups you want The Target of the Email Send to be validated against.
{}Animation 3:{}
Click the Validate button again.
{}Animation 4:{}
Ideally you will receive confirmation on screen that no problems were found.
If you do run into issues, you will see them outlined on this screen.
Tip:
For can-spam compliance, your template based emails will automatically have the default footer added to it, which is can-spam compliant.
But your custom html emails requires that you add it and this feature will inform you if it is not included.
{}Send Preview{}
Send Preview is a rendering of an email as it will be sent to a recipient.
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Spearker2:{}
{}(If there is one){}
Next, you will want to do a Send Preview which allows you to view an email as your recipients will when they receive it.
In the email work space,
{}Animation 1: {}click the Send Preview option on the toolbar…
{}Send Preview{}
You can select the list, recipient, and generate a preview for an individual subscriber
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker2: (if two speakers){}
{}Animation 1:{}
Now let’s select the List or Group you would like to check against.
{}Animation 2:{}
Then select a specific recipient
{}Animation 3:{}
Now to display your preview, click the Generate Preview button.
{}Animation 4:{}
You will then see a preview of how the email should render when sent to the selected recipient.
{}Animation 5:{}
And you can navigate through subscribers in the list or group by clicking the arrow buttons.
{}Live Demonstration:<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" /><size val="3600">{}Verifying Your Email</size>{}{}
Now let’s take a look at these features in a live environment, give me just a moment to set this up.
{}Sending Your Email{}
{}Transition back to Speaker 1 (if 2 speakers):{}
Now that we’ve verified the email and addressed any issues the application identified, our next step is to send a test email prior to sending the live email!
{}Sending Email{}
There are three options for sending email:
Test Send
Simple Send
Guided Send
{}Speaker 1:{}
There are three options for sending emails.
A test send is sent in order to test content appearance and personalization, most of the links will not work with that option.
A simple send is sent by selecting a list, the from name and address and clicking send all on one screen utilizing account defaults.
Finally, there is a guided send option that activates the Email Send Wizard, this choice gives you all of your sending options.
Let’s dig into each type of send…
{}Test Send{}
A test send allows you to preview the email and ensure the email displays as intended.
{}In Application<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr b=&quot;0&quot; i=&quot;1&quot; baseline=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />{}{}Speaker1:{}
The test send allows you to preview the email to ensure that it renders correctly in your email clients like, Hotmail, Yahoo, Gmail, etc.
{}Animation 1:{}
To do a test send, select the Test Send option from the send menu in the email creation toolbar.
{}Animation 2:{}
Enter up to five email addresses to receive the test send (your email address will be included by default)
{}Animation 3: {}and then click send.
If you would like to send to more than five addresses, you can repeat this process.
{}Animation 4:{}
You will then receive a confirmation that your test email(s) have been sent.
<size val="2400">{}Animation 5:{}
</size><size val="2000">When you view the Test Send, it will be clearly marked TEST SEND in the subject line.
Note that personalization will not be populated and will be displayed as the personalization strings – these will populate with the other sending choices.
Also, if you have any dynamic content included in your email, the default content will display no matter the recipient.
Remember, if you wish to view how the email will render for specific subscribers, you can leverage the Send Preview option within the application.</size>
{}Simple Send{}
A Simple Send chooses default options for your send and allows you to complete a send from a single screen
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker1:{}
The next option is the Simple Send.
Simple Send selects the default options for your send and allows you to complete an easy send.
This choice does not give you all of your sending options though,
{}Animation 1:{}
Now let’s select Simple Send from the Send menu in the email creation toolbar.
{}Animation 2:{}
The simple send wizard will then appear
{}Animation 3:{}
Select the lists or groups to send to,
{}Animation 4{}: you can also change the from name and address used in the send
{}Animation 5{}: and modify the subject line if needed.
{}Animation 6:{}
Click Send in the toolbar.
{}Animation 7:{}
And before the email sends, you will be prompted to confirm the send.
{}Guided Send{}
The Guided Send option will walk you through a send wizard and allow you to adjust your send configuration.
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker1:{}
The final option for sending that we will cover today is a Guided Send.
When you select this option, you will be presented with the Send Wizard, which will walk you through the process and allow you to make changes to your send configurations:
Select a list or group to send to.
Create rules based on that group or list.
Specify a From Email and subject line
Create a dynamic subject line, though it is not available in all accounts
Send the email immediately or schedule it for a specific date and time.
You will access the Guided Send from the send menu again and this will open the send wizard.
{}Animation 1:{}
Click next on the welcome screen.
{}Animation 2:{}
The recipients dialog box then opens.
{}Animation 3:{}
Then lets select the lists and/or groups to send to.
{}Animation 4:{}
And click next to continue the process…..
{}Guided Send{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker1:{}

This is a great option if you have other emails being sent to a list or group and do not want to overwhelm your subscribers with emails. </font></eff-l></fill-sd></kern></size>
{}Animation 1:{}
Now let’s set our send options.
<size val="1400">{}Animation 2:{}
</size><size val="1200">You can change the subject you created during the email creation process and add personalization if you’d like. </size>
{}Animation 3:{}
You can also select a different From Name and From address from the drop down menu or select a Send Classification you have created in your account.
{}Animation 4:{}
Sender Options allow you to send your email using multipart MIME – which sends both the HTML and text version of the email to every subscriber, track all links in the email, suppress the send from reports - which is a good option if the send is for testing purposes so it does not skew your reports, and enable send logging to a data extension – this feature is not available in all accounts.
You can also select a specific folder that you would like to have the tracking job placed into under tracking.
By default, your tracking jobs will be placed in the root “My Tracking” folder.
{}Animation 5:{}
We can also select Testing Options which will send all emails to that one email address entered here – use care when selecting this option as all of the emails will send to the address entered, as if it was sending to the subscribers in the list – This can overwhelm your company’s email server if it is from a large list.
If this feature is required, our support team can activate it for you.
{}Animation 6:{}
Next in the wizard is to determine if you would like the email sent immediately or scheduled for a future deployment.
{}Guided Send{}

Once that has been done, {}Animation 1: {}……toggle the box besided “The information is correct”</font></eff-l></fill-sd></kern></size>
{}Animation 2: {}….then the Send button is now available.
If you find something that is incorrect as you are reviewing, you can select the back button in the wizard to update what you have selected.
{}Animation 3:{}
Once you click send, a confirmation is displayed informing you that your email has been sent or successfully scheduled.
{}Animation 4:{}
The last thing to do is click finish and you are done

{}Cancelling a Send{}
How do you cancel a send?
If a send in progress is cancelled, some pending emails will be sent.
Emails already sent cannot be recalled.
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker1:{}
One final item I want to cover today is how to cancel a send.
When you are sending emails, you may have an ‘oh no’ moment… maybe you missed a configuration, or a typo is brought to your attention, and now you want to cancel the send.
{}Animation 1:{}
You can do that by navigating to Pending Sends
{}Animation 2:{}
It opens the pending sends dialog box
{}Animation 3:{}
Select the job you wish to cancel
{}Animation 4:{}
Click Cancel Send.
{}Animation 5:{}
It is important to note that if a send is in progress, some of the pending emails will be sent as it takes a few moments for the send to cancel and emails already sent cannot be recalled.
{}User Initiated Sends{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Another way to send emails is via User Initiated Sends.
We will now cover this method.
{}What is a user initiated send?{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
A user initiated send is primarily used for sending emails via programs, or automations, in the Interaction tab.
It allows you to set the parameters for a send once, but it may be used numerous times – i.e. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.
While it is primarily used for programs, you can send an email from the user-initiated workspace in the Interactions tab.
Next we will go over how you will set up a user initiated send and how to send the email.
{}Animation 1:{}
The first step in creating a user initiated send is clicking the create button in the toolbar of the workspace.
{}Creating a User Initiated Send{}
Speaker 1:
Next you will be taken to the properties page where we will set the parameters for the send.
{}Animation 1:{}
The first section is the Properties where you will give the user initiated send a name and an external key and description if needed.
You will also select your email.
It is important to note that the email needs to be created before you can create a user initiated send.
You will also have the opportunity to update the subject line and/or preheader if needed.
{}Animation 2:{}
If your account has Inbox Tools enabled you will also see the Seed lists option that allows you to select whether or not you would like to run Inbox Monitor, Inbox Monitor provides visibility into how the ISPs are treating your email campaigns.
For more information on Inbox Tools reach out to your Account Executive.
{}Animation 3:{}
You will then select your send classification.
As we saw with the guided send wizard, you have the opportunity to override the sender or delivery profile if needed.
{}Animation 4:{}
Under the Recipients section you will select the audience you want your message sent to, the targeted list, group, or data extension.
You can also pick audiences that you would like to be excluded from the send in this section just as you could with the guided send.
{}Animation 5:{}
You can choose a test Audience
{}Animation 6:{}
If CC and BCC are enabled in your account, you can include this information in the Message Properties section.
If using the CC functionality it is important to note that this field is visible to the subscribers.
{}Animation 7:{}
Lastly, you can determine where you want the tracking for the user initiated send to be placed.
By default tracking will be placed into the root My Tracking folder.
{}Animation 8:{}
The final step is to save your user initiated send.
{}Sending using a User Initiated Send{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Once you click save, you will be brought back to the User-Initiated send workspace.
If you check the box next to the user initiated send, you will notice that that the send button will no longer be grayed out in the toolbar.
{}Animation 1:{}
To send the email via a user initiated send, click the send button.
{}Animation 2:{}
This will bring you to a screen that allows you to select the time your email will be deployed.
You can select the Start immediately, run once or the Start on the following date and time, run once option, where you can select the appropriate date and time for the email to be delivered.
Both options will only run the user initiated send once.
{}Animation 3:{}
You are also able to review the parameters for the user initiated send that you set while creating the user initiated send.
If you find that there is an update to one of the parameters, you will need to select cancel and go back to the user initiated send itself to make updates the information.
{}Animation 4:{}
Your final step is to click send and the email will be deployed depending on what time parameter you set.

{}My Tracking{}
SUCCESS – GETTING STARTED
{}Speaker 1:{}
Let’s jump in and start getting familiar to the My Tracking section of the Salesforce Marketing Cloud.
{}Accessing Tracking{}
Tracking is an aggregated collection of data that allows you to view <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />critical elements
{}Speaker 1:{}
All tracking and reporting items are located under the tracking tab in the email application which is broken up into three sections - my tracking, my reports and my data.
Today we will focus on my tracking and my reports.
This Tracking area of the email application is an aggregated collection of data that allows you to view critical elements for your sends.
You will be able to track various items related to your sends including the unique and total opens,, how many links were clicked (and which ones), un-deliverables, and much more.
By default, tracking data will remain in your account for the duration of your contract.
{}Note:{}
Sometimes subscribers do not receive an email, but tracking doesn't show those emails as being undeliverable.
An email is deemed delivered as long as there isn’t a bounce received.
Remember when you created your template?
If you chose to create a template using HTML Paste, you may have seen a prompt to insert the email open tracking code into the email template, if it wasn’t already in your HTML.
As the open is counted by the tracking pixel loading in your account, if a subscriber has images turned off or they are not supported in their webmail client, their opens will not be captured.
One indicator that this has happened is there is a low number of opens, but a high number of clicks.
However even if the open is not captured because of this, events such as clicks and bounces will still be tracked.
{}Tracking Results{}
My tracking can be organized into folders.
{}Speaker 1:{}
To keep organized, My Tracking allows you to create folders for your email sends.
In some instances your folders will auto-generate and send auto-filters for particular types like Test Send Emails, Triggered Sends and A/B Testing.
{}Customized Display{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
<size val="2000">{}Speaker 1:{}
</size><size val="2400"><kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><eff-l val="&lt;a:effectLst/&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-lt&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">When you click into any of the folders in the tracking area, you’ll be presented with a table listing of respective sends for the folder.
You can customize what is displayed:</font></eff-l></fill-sd></kern></size>
{}Animation 1:{}
First you can select columns that are displayed by clicking Set Grid Preferences.
This opens the Tracking Grid Preferences where we can select columns you wish to add by toggling the associated box, or remove columns by untoggling the box.
This allows you to view initial information for the tracking items you are most interested in viewing for your sends.
{}Animation 2:{}
In addition, you can change the sort order to sort by any column by clicking the column header, and reverse the sort order by clicking the arrow icon on the header.
If you modify the view at all, it will automatically save, so next time you go back to that tracking folder the view will be exactly how you configured it.
Of course you can change it again at any time.
{}Toolbar Options{}
Move:
Move the email into another folder.
Delete:
Remove the email tracking from the application.
Cancel Send: stop a send in that is in progress.
Compare Email Sends:
Compares tracking data of one email to another email (more than one email must be selected).
Filter Options:
Change the number of {}emails{} or {}time since send{} to display.
Click the hyperlinked email name to access tracking data for that email.
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Aside from customizing your view, you also have additional options availability to you in the tool bar including:
Move – You’re able to move items from one folder into another.
Delete – you can remove email tracking data from the application
Cancel Send - stop a send that is currently underway.
Note that if you cancel a send it will not recall messages which have already been delivered.
Compare Email Sends – lets you compare tracking data of two or more email sends.
This a great tool to quickly review stats between two emails.
Filter Options - allows you to change the number or timeframe of emails displayed.
Finally, to access the tracking data for the job, click the hyperlinked name….
{}Tracking Workspace – Overview{}
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
You will be taken to the tracking details workspace for that send.
The workspace is divided into four tabs:
Overview
Click Activity
Conversions
Surveys
We will now walk through each tab.
First we will focus on The Overview tab.
This is going to provide you with a summary, deliverability rate, open rate, inbox activity, unengaged subscribers and Forward to a Friend (FTAF) activity.
This tracking data is presented  in a graphical format.
Some data points are going to be hyperlinked in this tab, clicking on those hyperlinks is going to allow you to dig down and obtain details.
Let’s take a closer look.
Summary includes basic information about your send including the:
{}Animation 1:{}
JOB ID (which is the unique identifier), the name and subject line, the date the email was sent and total sent (which may contrast the total delivered due to bounces.)
You are also able to see send performance:
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><size val="1400">{}Animation 2:{}
The deliverability rate – you generally want your deliverability in the high nineties.
</size><size val="1600">If there are bounces, you can click on the hyperlinked number to get the </size></fill-sd><size val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Bounce Reason and Description with a suggested remedy (i.e. – address unknown, contact subscriber using an alternate method to update information). </fill-sd></size>
<size val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{}Animation 3:{}
You can quickly view your open activity by using the Open Performance graph.
You are</fill-sd><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"> able to see Unique (individual subscriber) vs. the total opens numbers as well.</fill-sd>
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"> </fill-sd></size><size val="1400"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Remember open means images were rendered.
This is not a definitive measure for that reason so be sure to take click activity into account for your total opens.</fill-sd></size>
<size val="1400"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{}Animation 4:{}
The{} </fill-sd><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{}Inbox Activity or Current Activity displays opens, clicks, forwards using FTAF, conversion, Marketing Cloud surveys and unsubscribes.
You can c</fill-sd></size><size val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">hange to activity Over Time to view performance by date.
Most emails will be opened within 48 hours – however this may change based on your subscribers.
So this is a great tool to identify spikes, and therefore the appropriate time for response.</fill-sd></size>
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{}Animation 5:{}
The U</fill-sd><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">nengaged Subscribers section will show the total delivered (total sent minus bounces), and who did not click and who did not open.
Use these to dig down for required communications (such as HR communications) – and retarget subscribers (employees, partners, etc.) who have not taken a required action. </fill-sd>
{}Animation 6:{}
The last item on this page is the Forward to a Friend Activity, where you can quickly see how many subscribers have forwarded along a communication using the Forward to a Friend functionality.
We encourage you to include the Forward to a Friend feature in your marketing sends – this provides your subscribers a mechanism to share your email with friends they think will be interested, as well as a mechanism to protect their personal information and subscriptions in the subscription center.
{}Tracking Workspace – Click Activity{}
The Activity tab provides two views:
Email Overlay View
List View
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
The second tab is the Activity tab that allows you to view the click activity your email received.
There are two views available in this area; The first one is the Email Overlay View, it displays a preview of the email with percentages next to any hyperlink in the email.
{}Animation 2:{}
The percentage represents the number of clicks compared to the number of people that opened the email.
{}Animation 3:{}
In this view, clicking the hyperlinked percentage will open a dialogue box displaying the actual click through rate, the percentage of total clicks (actual total clicks) and the percentage of unique clicks (with the actual number of unique clicks displayed).
The Email Overlay View is why you want to differentiate links in your emails when they link to the same url – because the clicks are tracked by the tracking alias.
On this tab we can view the percentage of clicks, identify our most popular links and ensure they are moved up in the email (especially those links below the fold).
This is also the tab you want to export when you want to demonstrate the success of your campaign in driving traffic.
{}Animation 4:{}
When you select export, and export it in PDF, the file will then generate what you are seeing on the screen.
{}Animation 5:{}
The List View is going to display a list of links and clicks.
By default it will be displayed in order of the hyperlink which was clicked most to the one that was clicked least.
In this view, clicking the actual hyperlink will take you to that webpage, such as your website or a registration form.
If you click the hyperlinked number of clicks you are taken to a list of subscribers who actually clicked that link.
<size val="1400"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{}Animation 6:{}
</fill-sd></size><size val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Note by default only CLICKED links appear, we can include unclicked links by selecting the drop down. </fill-sd></size>
{}Tracking Workspace - Conversion{}
Conversions includes information on conversions from the email send including:
Path name
Unique conversions
See all click path data links
Number of unique conversions links
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Our next tab is conversions and includes information on conversions resulting from the email send including the path name, unique conversions, all click path data links, and the number of unique conversions links.
Conversions up to ten pages will be included in this tab.
This feature provides you a fantastic resource to consolidate your reporting by capturing conversions within the email application so you’ll be able to view the email, clicks and conversions all within one resource.
However, you do not have to use this feature for your sends if you do not want to.
{}Tracking Workspace – Survey{}
{}IN APPLICATION<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;2400&quot; b=&quot;0&quot; i=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />{}{}Speaker 1:{}
Next is the Survey Tab, if you have included a survey in an email, here is where you can view and track the responses.
On the left side of the work space you’ll see the Survey Questions.
Each question will be listed as well as the number of responses to give us an overall view of response rate.
On the right side of the screen, you’ll find the survey responses.
By default there will be a pie chart with the response rate of the survey (number of responses in relation to the number of opens).
Number of completions and response rate are great to know, but how do you view how our subscribers responded?
{}Animation 1:{}
Click on the questions and the Survey Responses will update to display the responses for that question.
The pie chart will be displayed as well as response details (number and percentage for each response).
{}Tracking Workspace – Job Links{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
The last tab you will see in the Tracking Workspace is the Job Links tab.
Sometimes you don’t catch a mistake, like a broken link in an email, until after you have hit send.
With our latest release, you can now edit a link in an email that has already been sent without having to reach out to Global Support.
It is important to note that only users with the Account Administer or Content Creator roles can edit links after an email is sent and you must be allowing the Marketing Cloud to track your click data.
{}Animation 1:{}
To edit the link, click on the URL ID associated with the link you are needing to edit.
When you are editing a link via the Job Links tab in Tracking, it is important to note that you are only changing the link for that specific Job ID and not the source email.
To ensure an edit is applied to the source email, you will need to navigate back to the content tab and make the edit there as well.
{}Live Demonstration:<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" /><size val="3600">{}Tracking Workspace</size>{}{}
Now let’s take a look at these features in a live environment, give me just a moment to set this up.
While I am setting this up, please add any questions in the widget, Phil will be checking for them.
{}Using Tracking Data{}
{}Speaker 1:{}
Now that you have all this tracking data, you are probably wondering what you can do with it!
There are several ways to use data in the tracking area and we will review common uses next.
For example, you can create a list, export subscriber data from tracking to an excel file, export the bounce reason and bounce description, compare the tracking results, or create PDF and Excel files of the tracking tabs.
Let’s start with how to create a list from tracking data…
{}Create a List from Tracking Data{}
{}IN APPLICATION<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr b=&quot;0&quot; i=&quot;1&quot; baseline=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />{}{}Speaker1:{}
Whenever you drilldown in the tracking data to view subscribers who did (or did not) take a particular action, you have the opportunity to add those subscribers to a list.
You can add subscribers to a preexisting list, or create a new one within the workflow.
Some great ways to apply this feature are to create a list of subscribers who clicked on a specific link to send a retargeted email, thank survey respondents for their participation in a survey, or to identify unengaged subscribers.
Let’s see how easy it is to create a list from tracking,
{}Animation 1:{}
Click the Copy All button in the toolbar,
{}Animation 2:{}
Then either select a list to add subscribers to, or create a list by selecting the New List radio button and entering the required List Name, though the description and marking public are optional.
{}Animation 3:{}
Then click Copy in the toolbar.
{}Exporting Subscriber Tracking Data{}
Subscriber data can also be exported to an Excel file (csv, tab delimited, or XML format).
{}Speaker1:{}
IN APPLICATION
Maybe you don’t want to make a list to take advantage of the data in the dig down, but you want to use the tracking data outside the system somehow… in that case, you will use the option of Exporting Subscriber Data to Excel.
{}Animation 1:{}
Within the dig down, you will click export from the toolbar.
{}Animation 2:{}
You can select the attributes you want to include in the export file by selecting items and using the arrow keys.
Depending on what you will be doing with the data outside of the Salesforce Marketing Cloud you can select only the attributes you need.
Next, select the file type  - CSV, tab delimited, or XML – all good options if you are going to import the data into another system.
This can be exported to your FTP, or attached in an email (if you don’t have FTP configured).
{}Animation 3:{}
The final step is to click Export.
{}Export Bounce Reason and Bounce Description{}
Exporting bounce reasons and bounce descriptions will allow you to ensure that you can address any deliverability issues you may encounter.
{}IN APPLICATION:{}
{}Speaker1:{}
Another tracking data export that comes in handy is the Export Bounce Reason and Bounce Description as it will allow you to address any deliverability issues you may have encountered.
To export this information, navigate to the Overview tab and….
{}Animation 1: {}…click the hyperlinked bounce number of the bounce type you want to export in the Send Performance section.
{}Animation 2:{}
Click the Export All button from the toolbar on the screen that lists the bounces.
{}Animation 3:{}
Now select the fields to export.
{}Animation 4:{}
In this particular instance, include the Undelivered Reason and the Undelivered Description.
Those two fields are important since they provide the reason why that email bounced.
Configure the remaining settings just like we did to export subscribers for delivery…
{}Animation 5:{}…and click Export in the toolbar when you’re done.
You can then use this data to either update your CRM system, determine which subscribers need contacted through another channel, or determine systemic issues your sends could be experiencing.
{}Compare Tracking Data{}
Emails can be compared and is a great tool to compare performance of a communication type over time.
{}IN APPLICATION{}
{}Speaker1:{}
<size val="2400"><kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><eff-l val="&lt;a:effectLst/&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-lt&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">Another very helpful option we have is to compare tracking data.
There are a lot of reasons why you’d want to compare emails – maybe you want to compare the performance of a certain email type, such as newsletters over time, or even compare different communication types to see which are most effective for engaging your subscribers.
You can even analyze testing results using this feature.</font></eff-l></fill-sd></kern></size>
First select the jobs you want to compare (two or more)
{}Animation 1:{}
Click Compare Email Sends in the toolbar.
{}Animation 2:{}
Then click view Results and the comparison will display onscreen.
From there, you can print or export the data if it is required outside the application.

*Click next to continue.*
*The Reports Tool can be found in the exacttarget marketing cloud.
To access the Reports tool you will click on Reports in the Marketing cloud app switcher.*
*You will then be taken to overview page.
On the overview page there will be three ways to access every report.*
*You can click on catalog in the tool bar or if you defined the specific report as a shortcut, you can click on that specific report.*
*You can also access a category of reports via the report catalog area.
The report catalog area will list all the reports categories available in you account.*
*In this account we have custom reports, discover reports, email reports as well as mobile connect and social pages reports. *
*The workspace below will display all of the report perimeter definitions that you have saved when creating reports in the past.*
*The very left hand side will allow you to filter those reports for quick and easy access.*
*The reports tool offers 3 types of reports:
Standard, Custom and Discover reports.*
*Each comes with various features and functionality that provides tailored options to review the data needed for your marketing campaigns.
Standard reports are available on all accounts.*
*The Custom and Discover reports are available for an additional cost.
Now let’s take a deeper dive into the different report types.*
*Click on the report type to review more information about each one.
Then, click ‘next’ to continue.*
*Standard reports allow you to access new and legacy reports previously run in each channel application.*
*All standard reports for the email application, mobile connect and social pages are available in the reports tool, making it easy to run any report from a single tool.*
*The report catalogue area on the overview page will list the channel applications available on your account and the number of reports associated with the channel.*
*In this example there are 41 standard email reports, 5 mobile connect reports, and 3 standard social pages reports.*
*Welcome to the ‘Reports Tool Overview’ module.*
*A standard report is a document that contains statistics or data usually over a period of time.
The layout and the standard information that will be included in the report are defined and cannot be altered.*
*When you run a standard report, you will specify certain report parameters.
Report parameters can vary depending on the report being run.*
*For example when running the campaign ‘Email Tracking’ report, you will need to specify the date range, a specific campaign, exclusions, time zone and the date format.*
*While the account ‘Send Summary’ has you specify, the date range, exclusions, time zone and date format.*
*Custom reports are created upon request.*
*These reports are viewable in the catalogue and are created when our Standard or Discover reports do not provide the information based on your specific use case.*
*In most cases the Premium reporting solution Discover will provide the data necessary as well as the flexibility to create a report based on your specific needs.*
*Discover is a premium reporting tool that gives immediate views into your marketing metrics.*
*Discover lets you control the report presentation and content, delivering speed of thought insights into crosstab PivotTable style reports.*
*It also has a rich interactive visualization based on data that is refreshed daily.*
*Congratulations!
You’ve just completed the ‘Reports Tool Overview’ lesson.*
*In this lesson you’ll learn what the reports tool is and why use the reports tool.
You’ll also learn how to access reports and the different types of reports that are available.
Click ‘next’ to get started.*
*What is a report?
A report provides you aggregate information about subscribers, sending, and other aspects of your email, mobile connect, mobile push or social pages applications.*
*There are three types of reports:
Standard, Custom and Discover.
Standard reports are available on all accounts.
Custom reports are being created specifically for your needs and Discover is our premium reporting tool.*
*If you’d like to learn more about discover, please take the online discover course. *
*Today we’re going to create a standard report in which case we will define the parameters for the report such as the date range, date format, and time zone.
Click ‘next’ to continue. *
*In this interactive simulation, you will create the campaign ‘Email Tracking’ report.*
*Congratulation, you’ve now completed the ‘How to Create a Report’ lesson.*
*To create a report you will navigate to ‘Reports’.
Reports can be found in the marketing cloud app switcher.
Click ‘Reports’.*
*To create a new report, you will navigate to the report catalogue from the ‘overview’ page.
The report catalogue is where all reports can be found.*
*The reports that will be listed in the catalogue will depend on the channel applications that are enabled on your account.*
*This account has email, mobile connect, social pages, and Discover enabled.*
*Therefore all email reports, both Custom as well as Standard, all mobile connect, social pages, and Discover reports are available in the report catalogue.*
*You can navigate to the report catalogue three different ways.
First, you can click on ‘catalogue’ in the toolbar.*
*The catalogue then will display every report available in your account.
You can also access a specific report in the shortcut area.*
*The most efficient way to access the report catalogue is via the ‘report catalogue’ area.*
*In the report catalogue area you will select the category and only the reports for that particular channel will appear.
To access a standard email report, click on ‘email’.*
*The report catalogue will now display all email reports.
You’ll notice that there are both Standard reports as well as Discover reports, and Custom email reports can also be found in the workspace.*
*To find a specific report we can use the filter area in the left-hand panel.
Filters allow us to set criteria for the type of report, and then only those reports meeting that specific criteria will appear.*
*In our case, we are going to filter for just Standard email reports.
Click the ‘standard’ checkbox.*
*In this scenario, you want to see how your birthday email campaign has been performing for the past seven days.*
*You’ll locate the campaign email tracking report, and then to create a report click on the ‘create’ button for the campaign email tracking report.*
*In the ‘create report’ dialogue box you are ready to begin to find the parameters for the report.
The first parameter is the date range.*
*To select a different date range click on the ‘date range’ dropdown.*
*Once again, our scenario is to see how our birthday campaign has been performing in the last seven days.
Select ‘last seven days’ from the dropdown.*
*In the next parameter, you will need to select the specific campaign to report against.
In this case it will be our birthday campaign.
Click on the select campaign ‘report against’ dropdown arrow. *
*Select the birthday program from the dropdown.*
*The next parameter is whether or not to exclude jobs where tracking is suppressed.*
*In our scenario we will leave the default ‘true’.
We will also leave the time zone, and the date format at the default for account.
Click to submit the report.*
*The campaign email tracking report now displays all the data for our birthday campaign.*
*It’s important to note that when exclude jobs where tracking is suppressed has been chosen, whether through the guided send, user initiated email, or send activity, all tracking data will be excluded from the report.*
*To save the parameters for the report, click ‘save’.*
*In the ‘save report’ dialogue box, you’ll begin by giving the report a name.
We will do this for you.
Click ‘next’ to continue.*
*Welcome to the module ‘How to Create a Report’.*
*The report’s source will automatically be populated, and the description field is an optional field.
In our scenario, we’ll leave that blank.
To save the report, click ‘save’.*
*Once the report has been successfully saved, let’s navigate back o the ‘overview’ page.
Click ‘overview’ in the toolbar.*
*The birthday program results ‘last seven days report’ definition now appears in the report’s workspace.
Click ‘next’ to continue.*
*Once the report parameters have been defined, you will run the report.*
*In this lesson, you’ll learn five ways to deliver and schedule a report.*
*The report can be saved or you can use one of the delivery or scheduling options available in the reports tool.*
*The final report option is the schedule option.
The schedule option allows you to take a report definition that has been saved and establish a recurring schedule for the report to be run.*
*The report then can be emailed, placed on an FTP or saved as a snapshot.
It’s important to note that the scheduling option is only available for reports that have been created via the reports tool.*
*Any report that’s been created via the reports tool cannot be added as a step in a program or in automation via Automation Studio.*
*To learn more about the scheduling option, click the ‘schedule’ icon.*
*In this interactive simulation, you’ll learn how to schedule a report.*
*Once the report definition has been created, you can save it and establish a recurring schedule.
In order for the ‘schedule’ icon to become active, you must first save your report definition.*
*After saving your report definition, click on the ‘schedule’ icon.*
*After clicking on the ‘schedule’ icon, the schedule report results dialogue box will appear.
The report name will be-pre populated with the name you gave the report when the report was saved.*
*The first parameter you will define is the start date.
You will click on the calendar and select a date for the schedule to start.
For our scenario, click on the 17{}th{}.*
*Once the start date has been selected, you will select a time for the report to run.
Click on the dropdown arrow to select a time.*
*From the dropdown select 7 AM as the start time.*
*If you need to select a different time zone for the report to run, click the dropdown, and then select the appropriate time zone.*
*Once you’ve established the date for the schedule to start, and a time to run the report, you’ll then select how often the report needs to be run.
Click on the dropdown.*
*You can choose to run a report once, hourly, daily, on the weekdays, weekly, monthly or yearly.
Depending on your selection, the repeat options will vary.
Select weekly.*
*When selecting the weekly option, you can run a report every week, every two weeks and so on.
We will run the report every week.*
*You will then select what day, or days of the week to run the report.
For example: you can select to run the report every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.*
*The default is Sunday.
In our example we will run the report every Monday morning.
You will begin by de-selecting Sunday.
Click on ‘Sunday’.*
*There are five options for delivering and scheduling a report.*
*To select Monday click on ‘Monday’.*
*After selecting when to run the report, you will then determine when the schedule will end.
You have two options: on date, and after.*
*The ‘after’ option will allow you to set the number of recurrences before the schedule will end.
The ‘on date’ option allows you to enter a date to stop the schedule.*
*We will select the default ‘on date’.
We will stop the program on January 1{}st{} 2015.
We will enter this for you.
Simply click in the textbox.*
*You can email the report, upload the report to the exact target and handstaff TP, download the report to your computer, save a snapshot of the report, or schedule the report to run on a recurring basis.*
*Once the schedule options have been defined, you are now ready to define the delivery options.
There are four choices for the format for this report.*
*Data file, which is the default, compressed file, and two types of Excel spreadsheets.
We are going to select an Excel spreadsheet.*
*When establishing a schedule for our report to be run, you need to determine how you wish to receive the report.*
*The report can be emailed to you, placed on the exact target and handstaff TP, or saved to the snapshot area.*
*The default is to have the report emailed.
In our scenario today, we are going to select to save the report to the snapshot area.
Click the radio button next to ‘save’ to reports.*
*To learn more about each of these options, click the icons below.
When you are finished, click ‘next’.*
*To save the schedule definitions, click ‘save’.*
*The browse re-targeting campaign last seven days report is now scheduled to run every Monday at 7AM.*
*The report will appear in the snapshot area.
Click ‘next’ to continue.*
*Congratulations, you’ve now completed the simulation!*
*One way to share the report is to email the report to yourself and others in your organization.
When selecting this option you can choose to send the email report to multiple email addresses.*
*The email addressed just need to be separated by a comma or a semicolon.
When emailing the report, there will be various file format options such as Excel spreadsheet, or CSV, or even a Zip file.*
*The format options will vary based on the report that you are emailing.
Click on the ‘email’ icon to learn more.*
*In the email report results dialogue box, you’ll begin by typing in a name for the report that will be delivered in the email.
The report source will automatically be populated by the report name, as it appears in the catalogue.*
*You will then enter in the email address, or email addressed of people you wish to send the report to.
Remember the email addresses must be separated by a semicolon or a comma.*
*You will then enter the subject line, and if you wish, you can include a note with the email.
Finally you’ll select the file format.*
*File formats will vary based on the report.
After selecting the file format, simply click save to email the report.*
*Another option for sharing and saving your report is to upload the report to a file transfer protocol site or FTP.*
*You can save your report to the exact target and handstaff TP.
The file type options will vary from report to report.*
*Click on the ‘FTP’ icon to learn more.*
*In the FTP report results dialogue box, you’ll begin by typing in a name for the report.

*The process for creating a report starts with selecting the appropriate report to run.*
*Snapshot is another option available to view your report.
When saving a report as a snapshot, you are saving that version of the report to an online file folder located in the reports tool.*
*This option is very useful for online collaboration.
For example: a group of people needs to review the ‘complaints by domain’ report every Monday morning, and compare the data to pass through ports.*
*Instead of emailing the report to everyone each week, the report can be saved as a snapshot.
People are able to see the most current version of the report in addition to any other previous snapshots that have been saved.*

Where did it go?
Go back into Social Studio.

From the Engage application in your Twitter feed column, you see a post from Tom Andrews asking for help with his tent setup.
Click the post and open the Inspect Post panel.
You can reply to Tom in real time to try to help him out.
Click the Reply Quick Action.
Then click Post.
You see a confirmation message that lets you know you've replied, and if you look back at the Engage column, you see the reply to Tom appear.
The next step is to send this to customer service in the Salesforce Service Cloud to ensure someone follows up with Tom about his tent setup issue.
Apply a previously created macro called Salesforce Macro Needs Follow Up.
Once that is applied, you can see that Tom's post status changes to Recommend Follow Up with a post label of Requires Follow Up.
You can see it is sent to Salesforce and a case has been created.
In the Salesforce Service Console you can see the post appear at the top of the list of social post cases.
Click on Tom's social persona to learn a little more about him.
Under Profile URL, you see a link to Tom's live Twitter page.
You can view his profile and previous tweets.

If you click the parent number for this case, it will bring up the Detail page.
Here you can see the article you provided Tom when you replied to him in Engage.
You can see the case number and Tom's post.
As a customer service representative using the Salesforce Service Console, you can reply directly in the console.
If you look at your response below, you can see it as being sent.
Once you see the response go through, take a look back in Social Studio.
Your post will show up at the top of the Engage column.
To set up an Engage tab template, go to the Workspace Settings page.
To access this page, go to the NTO Training drop-down
and click the gear icon.
This takes you to the Workspace Settings page.
Click Templates on the left hand side of the screen.
This is where any existing Engage tab templates will be.
Here you can edit any existing templates or create new ones.
To create a new one, click New Template.
This takes you to the page where you will build your new template.
Change the name of the template.
If you click the title, we will fill in the name Daily Social Tracking.
It is helpful to have a good naming convention to distinguish templates.
Since this one is for tracking daily social media posts, we will give the template that name.
Next, you can add social columns under the Build tab, or if you click Settings
You can add a description, click the Description box.
We will fill in the description of daily social tracking.
You can also set it up so this tab template automatically shows up as a tab within the Engage tool for newly added members of the workspace.
To add columns to the Engage tab template, go back to the Build tab at the top by clicking on it.
Next, click Social Account
and add the Twitter and Facebook accounts to track.
Then, click Add Social Account.
This brings up all of the posts from your Facebook and Twitter accounts.
Add another column.
Click Social Accounts again to add your Twitter and Facebook accounts.
Click Add Social Account.
Filter this new column by clicking the gear icon{}and then Filter.
Here you can assign this column to whatever user is logged in and using this template.
As a reminder, this allows users to quickly view your customized template.
So that you know this column is for the posts assigned to you, it will be labeled Assigned to Me.
Click the column title.
We will fill in Assigned to Me.
Close out of the Filter panel and the columns are available for anyone to use.
Once you have named your Engage tab template, added a description, and built your columns, you would save it by clicking Create and Exit.
There is a simple way to ensure consistency across teams regarding content that each individual user is seeing and interacting with.
As new members join your team, making your Engage tab templates automatically available upon logging in is an easy way to accomplish this goal.
Under Settings in the Engage tab template, you can control if someone will automatically have certain tab templates available to them in Engage, or if they must add it on their own.
Do this by checking the Automatically Create for Newly Added Members box.
If it is checked, newly added members will have the template available to them right away in their Engage tool.
When you first sign in as a new user, the initial screen you'll see is the workspace screen.
This user has been assigned to the NTO Training workspace, so click that workspace.
Click Engage at the top of the screen.
You'll see the Engage tab template is already here to use.
You can see the columns that were created in the Engage tab template titled Daily Social Tracking, the regular social account columns, and the ones that are assigned to this user.
If you are a current user and don't have the Daily Social Tracking tab automatically available in your Engage tool, click the plus button to add a tab.
You will see your choice of templates here as well as the option to choose Blank Template and Build Your Own.
Click the Daily Social Tracking option.
Click Create Tab.
Now that tab is added to your Engage tool and shows up at the bottom of your screen.
This user has 2 posts assigned to her.
She needs to respond.
To respond to posts in the Engage tab template that has been assigned to you, click on one of the posts under Assigned to Me.
The Inspect Post panel comes up.
Click the Reply button to reply to this customer.
We will fill in the reply here.
Click Post.
You will see a reply confirmation at the top.

Northern Trails TP
This brings up the Create Topic profile panel.

The first keyword is NTO.
Click Done.
To add another keyword, click the plus button.
We'll add Northern Trails.
Keywords are not case sensitive, so capitalization does not matter.
Define conversations specifically about camping in the End Contains Keyword section.
Add keywords camping, tents and hiking.

Say NTO is a local band, and you don't want to bring in conversations around NTO the band.
Exclude the keyword “music”.
You can also customize something called Keyword Proximity.
Click Northern Trails.
Now the words "Northern Trails" must appear right next to each other.
This is so that you don't have conversations brought in that have "Northern" in the first sentence and "Trails" in the third sentence.
Those conversations would not apply.
You can adjust this to have words in between.
For now, keep it with No Proximity.
With all the keywords filled out, click Create Keyword Group.
Filter options are Languages, Media Types, and Regions.
For Languages, deselect All Languages.
Select English and Spanish.

And find the previously created source group or create a new one.
To find out what the Sarah Smith Facebook profile is saying about your brand, copy her Facebook link
and click Add.
Name the source group
and click Save
to add this to the topic profile.
You can share this topic profile with a specific workspace.
You can also share with multiple workspaces.
To do this, go to the Sharing tab.
This topic profile is not shared with any workspace.
Click Edit Workspaces to see the list of workspaces within our tenant.
Share it with NTO Training
and click Apply.
This is to allow Full users, Basic users and users other than Super users to use the Topic Profile in the Workspace.
Now that you have created a topic profile, you will create an analyze dashboard called a social listening summary dashboard and apply the topic profile.
Click on Analyze at the top of the page.
To create a new dashboard, click Create New.
Choose Social Listening Summary.
This is the dashboard where you can apply a topic profile.
Since you shared this topic profile with the NTO Training workspace, which you are in now, you see it in this list.
To apply this topic profile, click the check mark next to it.
Click Create Dashboard.
This will create a social listening summary dashboard with the Northern Trails topic profile.
Here you can see common social metrics around Northern Trails.

This time you will add a Topic Profile.
Here you see the list of available topic profiles within the workspace NTO Training.
Click on the Northern Trails topic profile

Managing topic profiles through searching and sorting is simple.
You have a long list of topic profiles within your workspace.
To pull up the Northern Trails topic profile you can search to find it.
You can also sort topic profiles.
Click on Name to sort in alphabetical order,
Click again to show reverse order.
You can also sort by Owner.{}EMV,{}or Status.
As a super user, I can see all the topic profiles available within this tenant in the Admin and Topic Profiles view.
You can see here there are five different topic profiles within this tenant.
If I log in to the account of a full user,{}I can only see three topic profiles.
That is because a full user can only see the topic profiles that are shared with them.
If I click into this Northern Trails topic profile,{}I can see all the information,{}but I'm not able to edit any of it.
Only the super user can do that.
If you are a full user you can edit any topic profiles that you have created yourself.
