Resources & Tools
{}Speaker1:{}
Let’s first begin with understanding the resources and tools to help you implement salesforce.
{}Bookmark this URL:{}
{}www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted{}
Getting Started Quickstart
{}Speaker1:{}
New customers tell us they need help understanding where to start.
We’ve listened and consolidated the most critical resources into one central hub, called our Getting Started Quickstart page.
Bookmark the following webpage: www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted.
All the resources we’ll be discussing are accessible through this webpage.
Now, let’s dive in to the detail.
Getting Started Series
Live Webinars
On Demand Videos
http://www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted
{}Speaker1:{}
Customers also asked for guidance around implementing salesforce, so we created the Getting Started Series.
This four part series provides prescriptive steps for getting up and running with salesforce, taking you from preparation to deployment.
The content is divided into 4 main parts, including:
Prepare for success, where you’ll learn how to prioritize your business objectives
Create the user experience, which will provide you best practices on setting up salesforce to align with your business
Enable the User Experience with Data, which will focus on tips on how to prepare, import, and manage your data
and Deploy and Empower your end users, which will provide guidance on training, support, and motivation techniques to drive adoption
This series will arm you with the information you need to deploy salesforce.
Access the Getting started quickstart for links to register for live webinars and view on demand videos.
Set-Up Salesforce Series
http://www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted
{}Speaker1:{}
As you make your way through the series, another resource we want to highlight as part of our Create the User Experience step is the Setup Salesforce Series.
We created demonstration videos where saleforce experts guide you through completing baseline customization tasks, such as setting up users or leads.
After watching the demonstration, you can then access a step by step walkthrough which takes you directly in to your instance of salesforce to perform the task.
Let’s talk through an example:
A common task customers need to complete is creating a custom field.
To learn how to perform this task, begin with watching the Setup leads video.
Then, when you’re ready to customize, select the ‘add lead custom field’ walkthrough.
Get step by step guidance within your instance of Salesforce.
Walkthroughs
http://www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted
{}Speaker1:{}
The walkthrough goes directly to the lead setup area within your instance of salesforce.
It will take you step by step through the process of creating a new field within your lead object.
You’re not only viewing the steps, your completing them as you work your way through each step of the walkthrough.
By the end of the Setup Series, you will have completed the baseline steps for customizing salesforce.
Getting Started Workbook
Document your decisions
Define how to tailor Salesforce to your business
Access relevant resources
http://www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted

We talked about the webinars and the setup series.

Think of the workbook as your checklist to deploy salesforce.
Use it to <size val="1100"><kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">document your decisions, define how to tailor salesforce to your business, and find links to relevant resources.</font></fill-sd></kern></size>
The workbook will be a valuable reference document and a helpful tool to access as your business needs evolve.
Be sure to download the Getting Started Workbook from the quickstart page.
This will help you begin to understand the steps you will work through in the upcoming weeks.
Success – Getting Started Community
http://www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted
Get answers.
Stay connected.
{}Speaker1:{}
Customers also requested a place to ask questions and learn from others, which is why we created the Success – Getting Started group within our Success Community.
This forum was built to provide new customers a place to engage with salesforce experts and other customers like you.
Let me share two examples we saw last week within the Getting Started community;
- A new customer who has never implemented salesforce, posted a note to the community asking for their top 2 lessons learned during the implementation process.
He quickly received 10 posts from other customers and partners sharing their experiences.
- Another example is more specific.
A new customer had created custom fields on leads and needed to understand how to carry over these new fields to a converted opportunity.
She posted her question, and within an hour, she had answers from both a salesforce expert and a customer giving her a solution.
As a success resource here at salesforce, my goal is to make sure there is no question left behind in our community.
Later in the webinar, we’ll show you exactly how to join and take advantage of this valuable resource.
Meet the new user experience in Salesforce
Lightning Experience is a new, modern user experience in Salesforce
Lightning Experience
Salesforce Classic
{}Speaker1:{}
First, I want to take a moment to introduce our re-vamped user interface, called Lightning Experience.
Lightning was recently released in October 2015 and is primarily focused on providing sales users a more productive interface.
It is designed to enhance ease of navigation, data entry, and usability.
We are aware that some of you watching may still be using the previous user interface, now referred to as Salesforce Classic.
Some features are not yet supported in the Lightning experience, but are still available in Salesforce Classic.
Now, you might be asking yourself, “am I on the new Lightning Experience or Salesforce Classic”?
The best way to determine what you are using today is to view your home screen.
Lightning Experience
{}Speaker1:{}
(1) When you first log in to salesforce, do you see a vertical navy bar displaying icons running down the left side of the screen?
If yes, you are on the Lightning experience.
Classic Experience
{}Speaker1:{}
(2) If you log on and instead see a horizontal row of tabs across the top of your screen, then you are on Salesforce Classic.
General navigation is different in Lightning versus Classic.
If you are currently using the new Lightning experience, keep watching.
Getting Started Series
On Demand Videos
<lnk-c val="&lt;a:hlinkClick r:id=&quot;rId3&quot;/&gt;">{}www.salesforce.com/gettingstarted</lnk-c>{}
{}Speaker1:{}
The demos we perform in this webinar will be shown on the UI selected by the audience majority from our next poll.
We’ll be covering tips and terminology that applies to everyone regardless of whether you are using Lightning or Classic.
All of our webinars are available as a recordings.
We’ll be sending you an email with direct links to our on demand videos, or you can find our video link within the Getting Started Quickstart page.
We’ve included video demonstrations in both the classic and lightning experience, so be sure to watch the one that’s most relevant to you.
Learn how to navigate Salesforce
{}Speaker1:{}
Now, let’s take the time to go through how to navigate Salesforce with the new Lightning Experience user interface.
We’ll share some Salesforce terms to help you become familiar with key areas of the application.
We will cover the home page, the navigation bar, and app launcher.
We’ll share the new layout for our most common objects including the Lead, Account, contact and Opportunity records.
Then, we’ll cover how to get to the setup for configuration and customization.
Let’s dive in!
{}Collapsable Navigation Menu{}

Elements of the home page
An intelligent way to start your day fast
{}Speaker1:{}
WHEN YOU first login to salesforce, you will land on the home page.
Here are a few key areas I want to highlight:
On the left hand side is the collapsable Navigation Menu, which allows you to easily navigate through your business data and objects within your salesforce account.
In the top middle of the home page is a performance chart.
This area will help you monitor how close you are to reaching your sales performance goals.
Below the performance chart, you’ll find Account Insights, which provides updates and highlights about your most important accounts.
The far right hand side is labeled Assistant and helps sales reps identify exactly what they need to be doing today based on activity information .
At the very top you will see the Global Search Bar.
This is a powerful search engine that will guide you to records in Salesforce.
It is important to note you can use an “*” as a wild card in searches.
This new Lightning Experience home page is not yet customizable.
We know customers want the ability to modify what appears on this home page, and this flexibility will be added in a future release.
Also, not all of your objects will appear in the navigation menu.
To view more objects, let’s navigate directly to the App Launcher.
{}App Launcher{}
App Launcher
View all of your applications via the App Launcher
{}Speaker1:{}
Users can find applications by searching for the app name in the global search bar or by using the App Launcher.
(1) The App Launcher appears at the top right hand corner of every page.
(2) Click on the icon containing several small tiles, and this will bring up the App Launcher.
Apps display as large tiles and are labeled with (3) sales, marketing, and more.
Access to all custom objects, are located within the Other Items tile.

{}Speaker1:{}
There are several ways to find what you’re looking for fast.
When you click into the global search bar at the top of the page, you’ll see a drop down of your recently viewed items.
When you know what you’re looking for, you can begin typing and the search bar will try and match your search and display records that match your criteria.
The search function also displays your results placing your most frequently used objects at the top of the list.
List Views
See your data, your way, with easy filters and visualization tools
{}List View Charts{}

{}Speaker1:{}
In Lightning Experience, when you access a specific object, you are taken directly to a list view.
You can manage your list views right from this page, use the Filter widget to add, set or remove filters and also get quick visualizations of your business data with Charts.
Using Setup
{}Speaker1:{}
To navigate to the setup menu, go to the upper right hand corner of every page and click on the Gear icon and select "Setup Home“ from the Quick Access Menu.
Our Setup page provides a streamlined interface for viewing and managing your administrative setup tasks.
The Quick Find (1) search lets you quickly navigate to any node using a keyword.
Quick Find is the best way to find what you're looking for if you know its name and it’s your power tool for getting where you need to go!

Understand Salesforce components
Now that you have the understanding of the resources and tools available, let’s introduce the core Salesforce objects you will set up to enable your sales process.
The Fundamental Objects of a Sales Process
{}Leads{}
Any person <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />that <fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;00A1E0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{}may be interested</fill-sd><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;1C1C1C&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{} </fill-sd>in <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />your products <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />or services.
{}Contacts{}
Individual directly <fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;00A1E0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{}associated with <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot; b=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;00A1E0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />an account</fill-sd>{} and possibly one or <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />more opportunities.
{}Opportunities{}
Any <fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;00A1E0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{}potential revenue-generating sales deal{} </fill-sd>or event you want to track.
{}Accounts{}
Organization with an <fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;00A1E0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{}established relationship</fill-sd>{} to your company.
{}Activities{}
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;00A1E0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{}A detailed interaction log</fill-sd>{} for a call, a follow-up task or a calendar event.
Our sales cloud standard objects in Salesforce includes Leads, accounts, contacts, opportunities and activities.
Let’s discuss each in more detail:
Leads are people who are interested in your products and services but have not yet purchased.
They are typically unqualified leads and generally come in from websites, events and purchased lists.
Often leads are the handoff mechanism between Marketing and Sales.
Accounts are companies that you have a relationship with, including:
Prospects, Customers, Partners and Competitors
Contacts are people associated with an Account that matter to your business.
Examples include:
Sponsor and Decision Makers, Influencers, Assistants and Partners.
Opportunities are potential revenue-generating sales deals that you wish to track through a sales process until the deal closes.
They are used to view pipeline and determine actions needed.
Activities are call logs, follow-up tasks, calendar events and emails associated with a managing your Leads, Contacts, Accounts and Opportunities.
The Fundamental Objects of a Sales Process
Demonstration
{}Convert the lead into an Account, Opportunity, & Contact{}
{}Add new opportunities & contacts to an account{}
{}Create a Lead & Associate a task{}
{}Track your opportunity through the sales process{}
Now, we’ll take you through a demonstration of a typical sales journey.
We’ll show you:
1) how to create a lead and associate a task to the lead,
How to qualify and covert the lead into an account, contact, and opportunity.
How to Track your opportunity through your sales process
And how create new contacts and opportunities within an account
Demonstration
Core Salesforce Objects (Example Sales journey)
{}Demo Script:{}
{}** Navigational steps are slightly different for each UI (Classic/LEX){}
{}Take audience through a typical sales journey.{}
I’m at my desk and I have an incoming call from our toll free number.
It is a person we haven’t done business with that is interested in our products.
I take the information down in our lead tab and create a follow-up task for a meeting scheduled tomorrow.
Create lead and create a new follow up Task.
{}Fast forward to tomorrow, I find out this is a great prospect, they have budget, our products are the right match so this is a qualified lead.{}
{}I update the task and mark it closed{}
Check all checkboxes (Product Interest, Budget, Approval) to qualify lead > SAVE > Then Close task
{}Take audience through Conversion Process and the Account record (360 degree view){}
Convert lead, create an Account, Contact, Opportunity, Follow up task to create a quote
Show Account page / 360degree view of customer
-Add a New Key Contact to Account
Administrators:
Set-Up Users
One of the first steps for Administrators is to set-up your users.
The reason we suggest setting up users at the beginning, is to help you assign your data appropriately as you are entering it into Salesforce.
Security basics for user setup
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;accent1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">{}Role Hierarchy{} </fill-sd><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;3B3B3B&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">determines the level of visibility users have to records such as opportunities they don’t own</fill-sd>
Ensures that managers always have access to the same data as their employees
Usually mirrors your organization's structure
{}Sales Rep{}
{}Sales Manager{}
{}CEO{}
{}Sales Rep{}
{}Sales Rep{}
{}Sales Manager{}
{}Sales Manager{}
{}Central{}
{}West{}
{}East{}
You will see your own records and the records of your employees
29
When setting up users, you will need to create a role hierarchy and assign users to the roles.
Similar to an organization chart, a role hierarchy represents a level of data access that a user or group of users needs.
The role hierarchy ensures that users higher in the structure always have access to the same data as people lower in their structure.
Role hierarchies don’t have to match your organization chart exactly, but usually mirrors the general structure.
This is an item you should setup immediately.
There is more you can do with security however, this one step is our recommended task, set up your roles and then assign them to users when you create your users.
Steps to set-up users
Create role hierarchy
Enter users
Select appropriate profile and role

<font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;-112&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;MS PGothic&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;-128&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;ＭＳ Ｐゴシック&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;-112&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;-128&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">Remember, create your roles, create your users and assign their roles and profiles.
Make sure you fill out the user fields like title, company, phone numbers and address so any email templates you create later show their complete company information.
Follow these steps to set-up your users so they have access to Salesforce and so that they can be assigned to data as you enter it into Salesforce.
These steps are also included in the Getting Started Workbook, which may be downloaded with the link provided here.
</font>Here is a quick best practice, you can set up users with the “Read Only” profile which allows you to make them record owners but at the same time, they can login and start becoming familiar with Salesforce.

Key players are most directly involved in the details and are typically in charge of driving business process alignment efforts and overall implementation strategy and activities.
<font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}<animation2></font><kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}The system administrator understands the business processes and has the expertise to configure Salesforce to achieve your objectives.
They are often responsible for training end users and supporting them after your deployment. </font></fill-sd></kern>
<font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}<animation3></font><kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}Business Process Owners know your sales process and have business goals they want to enable with salesforce.
They will work closely with the system administrator, and help validate that salesforce is set up correctly to support their business objectives. </font></fill-sd></kern>
Supporting players are critical to the success of the implementation as well but play a more indirect role.
<font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}<animation4></font><kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}The Data Analyst is responsible for determining which data should be imported into salesforce.
They are often the individuals in your company who know the data in your current CRM system or spreadsheets. </font></fill-sd></kern>
<font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}<animation5></font><kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}Champions are influential people in the organization who are passionate about the implementation and take a vocal role in representing the end user community.
Some of the best champions are sales reps who can help represent the needs of the people who will be using salesforce everyday. </font></fill-sd></kern>
<font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}<animation6></font><kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}Lastly, the Executive Sponsor drives the salesforce vision and communicates the strategy for what you want to accomplish.
Often they hold a senior leadership positions and encourage managers and end users to adopt Salesforce.
This role is critical.
Research indicates that having strong executive sponsorship is one of the top contributing factors to a successful implementation. </font></fill-sd></kern>
For mid to large-size companies, there are likely additional roles involved, such as integration leads, developers, and dedicated trainers.
And for smaller organizations, employees usually wear multiple hats.
For example, the role of executive sponsor and business process
owner could be the same person whose role is to own the strategy and make decisions on the business process.

Next, one of the first decisions you’ll make is how to approach the implementation.
There are 2 paths you can take.
Let’s talk about these two paths in detail.
When to self implement?

Local Presence
Resources available to help to engage with a partner:
{}Speaker2:{}
Our recommendation is to engage with a certified implementation partner.
This has historically been the fastest path to success because partners have the skills and resources to get you up and running quickly.
Partners also have industry and product expertise, as well as connections to local resources who can assist you in person.
Engaging with a partner will increase your time to value.
Partners are flexible and can tailor an engagement to fit your requirements.
Some customers engage with partners for the entire implementation, from design to deployment.
Whereas others choose to leverage partners for a specific project or task.
For more information on where to find partners, visit our AppExchange and engage with your Account Executive.
We create a resource called Successfully Implement with Salesforce Partners.
This guide will help you understand the process of working with a partner and how to prepare.
Partners also typically help with launch strategy and planning - Communication, train the trainer, documentation etc. these are all things they can help you with but remember that you need to drive what you want from them.
Remember that some Partners simply come in and do the analysis and design while you execute if you have internal expertise.
There are many combinations of collaboration with partners.
We have a great resource for you to use that includes valuable advice when working with partners.
We recommend you view the materials from this training link on this slide!
You’ll find the link in the resource section of this deck.
Here is a quick story I want to share:
I worked with one customer that chose to self implement but hired a certified consultant for a fixed 20 hours.
The customer used that time to have the consultant validate processes, designs and train the sys administrator on how to implement and configure some of the more difficult tasks.
Gather Feedback
{}Speaker2:{}
Business users are stakeholders who should be involved from the planning phase through to deployment.
Let’s discuss how to gather feedback to drive a successful implementation.
{}Resistors have important information, don’t avoid them{}
Consider how people handle change
{}Neutrals{}
{}Resistors{}
What most people resist is being controlled – not change itself
Know your personalities
{}Champions{}
{}Early adopters{}
{}Speaker2:{}
Not everyone adapts to change easily, so understanding your users and how they will react is important.
Here are some examples of the types of learners you’ll likely confront and how they can help with the implementation:
1)  Early Adopters are great testers for your system.
They are comfortable with change and new technology, so make sure you utilize them for your testing process.
Champions are great trainers and advocates.
Often times they have been exposed to Salesforce and are very excited so utilize it again.
3)  The majority of your users will fall in the neutral bucket.
Make sure you work to have them provide feedback.
4)  And finally, resistors don’t like change.
However, they can help validate good design and drive success so listen to them and seek out their feedback.
{}Are you meeting your objectives?{}
{}Is your solution easy to use?{}
Form a change leadership team
Why
Help people fell consulted, not controlled
Evaluate and prioritize user requests
Form a team to provide ongoing feedback
Who
Invite early adopters and resistors to have a voice
Focus on individuals who are trusted <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;002044&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans Light&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans Light&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />by their peers
Ensure execs are included and informed
{}Speaker2:{}
We recommend forming a change leadership team to help drive a successful implementation.
This team will be responsible for analyzing and prioritizing feedback.
As we discussed earlier, you will confront users who will be resistant to change, so being proactive in listening and actioning feedback provides several benefits:
If users feel they have been consulted from the beginning, versus mandated to adopt, it will drive more commitment to the project.
Your change management team can evaluate and prioritize these requests to make sure feedback is being heard
and make sure this is an ongoing part of the process.
This group of individuals will be your standing team of consultants to help you evaluate and plan as you evolve Salesforce.
When you think about who should participate, you want to invite your early adopters and resistors to make sure everyone has a voice.
Make sure the people selected are respected and trusted by their peers
And be sure your executive team is included and informed on progress.
For smaller organizations, your team might be comprised of your system administrator, your executive sponsor or business owner and some key users.
For a larger organization, you’ll want to ensure all parties are represented but that your team doesn’t become so large that you can’t make decisions easily.
{}Have users validated their business processes within Salesforce?{}
Develop your validation process
<font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans Light&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans Light&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">Identify your testers.

Enlist your early adopters and resistors!) </font>
Document the validation approach.
Provide a test environment.
{}Speaker2:{}
Make sure you include user acceptance testing as part of your plan.
In addition to technical testing, test the entire business process.
We refer to this as end to end testing.
Write up a couple real-life business scenarios your users will confront once they're live on salesforce, and use those as test scripts.
For example, you’ll test your sales process using opportunities.
Start by creating an opportunity.
Are the sale stages correct?
Are the fields easy to navigate?
Is there a field where adding help text would make it more clear on what data is needed?
Here are some example questions to ask your testing team:
Was there any point where you were unsure of what to do next?
Was there any point where you completed a step and something unexpected happened?
Customers on Enterprise edition or above you have access to a sandbox environment for testing.
If you are on Professional edition or below, consider creating a test user for this validation process which you can later deactivate.

Be sure to download the Getting Started workbook from the resource link available below this video.
I includes a section that helps you outline your validation plan.
The workbook will help you define quickly the key considerations when you build out this plan.
Now {}<Speaker1>{} is going to discuss the importance of communication and getting the word out to your team.
Get the word out
{}Speaker1:{}
Project communication is one of the most important aspects of a successful CRM implementation.
Communication helps drive adoption by providing an understanding of:
What challenges Salesforce is solving
What benefits will be gained
What is needed from end users
And what end users need to know

For High Impact:
Executive Sponsor Communicates
{}Speaker1:{}
We recommend developing a communication plan to build enthusiasm for the project.
Here are some examples broken down in phases.
For the build phase, engage your sponsors and champions to start promoting the project and upcoming launch.
Send out teaser emails stating some benefits end users will achieve with salesforce.
These communications are about creating buzz and excitement for what’s to come.
{}<animation 1>{}
The awareness phase is to announce the upcoming launch of salesforce to your end users.
Keep them informed by communicating the plan and timeline through kick off meetings and hosted office hours.
Invite your sponsors and champions to participate in these sessions to show their support publicly.
Ask the key users from your change leadership team to help communicate updates to their parts of the business.
This ensures you get wider buy-in and awareness.
Let your sponsors and champions help build engagement and energy!
And don’t forget to engage your executive sponsor to make an announcement and show their support of the project.
This will be a high impact message to the team.
{}<animation 2>{}
Finally, build a plan for post launch to keep the communication going.
Provide updates on end user adoption.
Continue to have your executive sponsors explain the value they are achieving.
Schedule status meetings with sponsors and key stakeholders to report progress and maintain their engagement.
You can even design user contests to generate excitement, adoption, and commitment to the project.

Chatter Quickstart
{}Speaker1:{}
We also recommend creating a chatter group dedicated to your salesforce project.
Chatter is a natural fit to help with the rollout by providing  one central location to consolidate all collateral and conversation around the project.
Use this group to share important milestones and timelines.
Upload all training documents and collateral used to support the launch.
As an Administrator, you can upload resources and communicate your training plan through chatter.
Encourage users to share feedback and ask questions within the group in order to capture all conversation in this central location.
This also makes it clear to users where they need to go to find resources, get information, and ask questions related to the project.
By introducing users to Chatter early on, they’ll immediately understand the benefits of collaboration in Salesforce.
Creating a Chatter group is easy.
We’ll share how to create a chatter group in the demonstration chapter of this Prepare video series.
And to learn more about Chatter, review the Chatter quickstart page which is included in the resource deck directly below this video.
Meet the new user experience in Salesforce
{}Speaker1:{}
We are now going to hop into a demo but First, I want to take a moment to introduce our re-vamped user interface, called Lightning Experience.
Lightning was recently released in October 2015 and is primarily focused on providing sales users a more productive interface.
{}Speaker1:{}
When you first log in to salesforce, do you see a vertical navy bar displaying icons running down the left side of the screen?
If yes, you are on the Lightning experience.
{}Speaker1:{}
If you log on and instead see a horizontal row of tabs across the top of your screen, then you are on Salesforce Classic.
General navigation is different in Lightning versus Classic.
We’ve included video demonstrations in both the classic and lightning experience, so be sure to watch the one that’s most relevant to you.

Identify and prioritize goals
{}Speaker1:{}
Once you’ve opened the lines of communication in your organization you’ll be able to clearly identify and prioritize your goals.
{}<animation1>{}The first thing you want to address are your pain points and challenges at your company.
{}<animation2>{}Answer questions to uncover these challenges, like what obstacles are impacting revenue generation, or how can we improve our sales processes?
{}<animation3>{}Next,  identify and prioritize your goals to begin building your roadmap.
This prioritization step is often missed, but very important.
Each goal your team creates should be ranked in terms of importance and impact to the business.
Then, priority is agreed upon across the key stakeholders.
{}<animation4>{}From your goals you will have business priorities, such as winning more deals or increasing sales rep efficiency.
And finally define how and what you will measure in salesforce to understand if you are achieving your goals.
Identify and prioritizing goals and how you will measure progress is a collaborative effort across the entire team.

Define Measures for Business Priorities
{}Speaker1:{}
Let’s walk through an example.
{}<animation1>{}We start by articulating our pain point and challenge.
We know we’re losing deals to competitors, but we don’t know who or why.
We want the ability to track competitors in our sales process and build a strategy on how to better position our products and services against these competitors.
{}<animation2>{}Our goal is to enable our reps to capture who they are competing against, and why we lose the deal.
{}<animation3>{}This is a top priority across our organization as we strive to win more deals and increase are revenue.
<font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}<animation4></font><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" sym="&lt;sym val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:sym typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}Once we begin tracking the data, we can build reports to measure progress.
What is our win/loss rate by competitor, who are our 2 top competitors by product line, and what are the top 3 reasons we lose?  </font>
Defining and tracking these goals are critical to keep the team aligned on your organization’s business priorities.

Best Practice:
Identify your pain points, capture and prioritize goals
Getting Started Workbook
{}Speaker1:{}
Use our Getting Started Workbook to guide you through the process as it contains examples and templates to help you along the way.
First capture your pain points across the organization.
It will help you establish clear goals and metrics, then prioritize which goals you tackle first.
Download the workbook directly from our Getting started quickstart page.

Measure your success
{}Speaker1:{}
Once your goals and priorities are defined, it is important to create a plan on how you will measure implementation success.
Metrics can be tracked from the beginning and provide guidance around what’s working well and identify areas for improvement.
Why measure success?
{}Measurement is crucial for your{} {}implementation success!{}
Know what’s working and what’s not
Justify your investment
Reward desired behavior
Ensure the expected value
{}Speaker1:{}
Measurement is crucial for the adoption of business systems like Salesforce.
You need quantifiable results so that you have something tangible to report back to the business showing the value obtained from Salesforce.
Create metrics that track end user adoption and measure against your goals to gain insight on progress.
Keep this data within the context of the use cases you identified at the beginning of the process.
Measurement helps you know what’s working and what’s not.
Adoption and success will evolve.
Data analysis can help you identify areas that need adjustment and the team can prioritize based on importance.
For example, if you’re using salesforce to drive pipeline, you can measure the volume of new opportunities being created.
If it seems low, the team can proactively reach out to sales, uncover blockers, then drive improvements.
This information is essential in helping your stakeholders justify their investment.
They want to be assured that the expected business value is achieved.
For example, are you closing deals faster, finding competitor information quickly?
It also provides an opportunity to reward desired behaviors.
You can reward your power users to encourage adoption.
You have invested in Salesforce as a business tool, are you realizing your goals?
Are you receiving the value you expect from the system?

{}Measure Business Performance{}
Engagement
Productivity
Effectiveness
{}Speaker1:{}
Next, let’s walk through some examples of what to measure.
We’ve broken this into 3 categories: engagement, productivity, and effectiveness.
Success metrics will evolve over time, but at the start of your deployment, you will want to understand how users are adopting the system and track the quality of data being entered.
We have Adoption and Data Quality Dashboards available for download on the AppExchange.
These prebuilt dashboards include reports and dashboard components that allows you track metrics like:
who’s logging in? how many opportunities or activities records are being created? is there data missing with opportunities?
This insight allows your Salesforce team to track progress and measure adoption.
We’ll cover how to download dashboards from the appexchange in the demonstration video in the next chapter.
{}<animation 1> {}It’s important to gather feedback.
We shared in chapter 2 how you can track feedback through using a chatter group.
You can also explore using a formal survey with your users to get feedback and measure overall sentiment.
Are users satisfied with salesforce?
Can they collaborate easily?
Can they find content?
Are they closing deals faster?
Capturing this type of insight is best suited for a survey.
There are a number of survey tools available on the appexchange.
{}<animation 2> {}Effectiveness relates to company specific key performance indicators.
These are concrete business metrics that will resonate with a CEO, CFO, or a business manager and they are unique to every company.
For example, a sales-driven company may tie success to decreasing the length of the sales cycle or increasing win rates against competitors.
Your company will decide which metrics you want to measure to understand how salesforce is impacting the business.
We cover examples in the Enable your user experience with data session, where we talk through prebuilt reports and dashboards that can give you a jump start on analytics.
Best Practice:
Define your success metrics

{}Note:{}
{}Update workbook with priority categories, etc.{}
Earlier, we used the Getting Started Workbook to outline our business goals and how we would measure success.
Now, use the workbook to document how you’ll measure progress by identifying what adoption means to your organization and how you will measure it.
Typically, customers take a phased approach to analyzing adoption.
It’s important to have quick wins that provide encouragement to users, so make your goals realistic and attainable so you can celebrate achievements and milestones.

Data serves as the life-blood of your Salesforce solution, serving to power the reports, dashboards, and automation features that enable you to run your business.
We will share with you what we’ve learned about the data import process.
Additionally, we will discuss how to best maintain that data once it’s in so you can continue to derive valuable information for your business.
In addition we will discuss how you turn that data into rich information to drive your business forward and achieve your goals.

Define your sales process
{}Speaker1:{}
Outlining your basic sales process is one of your first steps as you implement Salesforce.
This will help you define much of what you will configure in salesforce, from custom fields and sales stages to page layouts and reporting needed.
The Fundamental Objects of a Sales Process
Leads
Accounts
Contacts
Opportunities
Activities
{}Speaker1:{}
Before we start, let’s talk about the sales cloud standard objects in Salesforce.
Leads, accounts, contacts, opportunities, let’s go into more detail
What is a Lead?
{}Leads{}
The people interested in your products or services
{}Sources{}
Where you get your leads
{}Activities{}
Actions like tasks, calls, and events
{}Speaker1:{}
Leads are people who are interested in your products and services but have not purchased before or it they may indicate an opportunity to sell to an existing customer.
Generally, these come in from websites, events and purchased lists, often these are the handoff mechanism between Marketing and Sales.
They are often used by Inside Sales to facilitate qualification of potential deals
They’re fundamental to performing any kind of marketing ROI analysis
They’re separate from your company's Accounts, Contacts, and Opportunities
They’re necessary to take advantage of the Salesforce anti-duplication utility
You will want to track lead sources to understand the best source for your leads, ROI, etc.
You will also want to track the activities associated with the lead to understand where a lead is cold, what actions are driving conversions, etc.
Define your Lead Process
Map Your Process to Salesforce CRM Functionality
Map your ideal process to Salesforce CRM and establish the names you give to your data elements and the fields in Salesforce CRM.
Determine how you will measure and track
How you will measure conversion and top performers?
Determine how Leads will be assigned and qualified
How do you manage unassigned leads?
Identify Lead sources
Where do leads come from?
So here are the steps you should follow to build your processes around leads
Where do your leads come from?
• You probably will acquire leads by importing, creating manually, or automatically capturing them from your website.
<Animation 1> Next, How will you assign and qualify your leads?
You’ll need to determine the process where leads are assigned and qualified so think about that.
<Animation 2> You’ll want to determine how you will measure and track your leads
For example, how will you measure conversion and top performers
<kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;tx1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;-112&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;MS PGothic&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;-128&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;ＭＳ Ｐゴシック&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;-112&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;-128&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;"><Animation 3> And then finally, you will map this lead process to salesforce functionality.</font></fill-sd></kern>
Use the Getting Started workbook to help with this mapping.

Deal Information
Lead Conversion
<size val="1100">{}Speaker1</size>:{}
<animation 1> Once the lead is a qualified opportunity, it is converted.
<animation 2>
<animation 3> The company information such as brand name and location are captured on the account.
<animation 4> The contact information such as individual name and email are captured on the contact.
<animation 5> And the deal information such as potential revenue, anticipated close date are captured on the opportunity.
Let’s dig into each of those standard objects.
What is an Account?
{}Accounts{}
Companies that you have a relationship with
{}Partners{}
Customers
Competitors
{}Prospects{}
<size val="1100">{}Speaker1</size>:{}
Accounts are companies that you have a relationship with, including:
Prospects – these are organizations that are not yet customer but you’re working a deal
Customers – these are organizations that have purchased goods and/or services from you
Partners – these are organizations that work with you to sell goods and/or services
And Competitors – these are organizations where you want to track who you compete against for business
What is a Contact?
{}Contacts{}
People in an account who matter to your business
{}Decision makers{}
Partners
Influencers
{}Assistants{}
<size val="1100">{}Speaker1</size><km val="0"><strike val="noStrike"><kern val="0"><cap val="none"><spc val="0"><normh val="0"><ln val="&lt;a:ln&gt;&lt;a:noFill/&gt;&lt;/a:ln&gt;"><eff-l val="&lt;a:effectLst/&gt;"><ul-f val="&lt;a:uLnTx/&gt;"><fill-uf val="&lt;a:uFillTx/&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Arial&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;-112&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;MS PGothic&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;34&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;-128&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;ＭＳ Ｐゴシック&amp;quot; pitchFamily=&amp;quot;-112&amp;quot; charset=&amp;quot;-128&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">:</font></fill-uf></ul-f></eff-l></ln></normh></spc></cap></kern></strike></km>{}
Contacts are people associated with an Account that matter to your business.
Examples include:
Sponsor/Decision Makers
Influencers
Assistants
Partner Liaisons
What is an Opportunity?
{}Opportunities{}
Potential revenue-generating deals
{}Forecast Revenue{}
Generate Pipeline
{}Track Deals{}
<size val="1100">{}Speaker1</size><kern val="0">:</kern>{}
Opportunities are:
Potential revenue-generating sales deals that you wish to track through a sales process until the deal closes.
They are used to view pipeline and determine actions needed (for example more leads into the funnel; deals staying too long at a certain stage).
Opportunities are set up with consistent opportunity stages and probability to allow you to forecast sales by projected close dates.
Define your Sales Process
Map Your Process to Salesforce CRM Functionality
Map your ideal process to Salesforce CRM and establish the names you give <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1700&quot;&gt;&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;002044&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />to your data elements and the fields in Salesforce CRM.
Determine how you will measure and track
How you will measure win/loss ratios, won deals to quotas & top performers?
Determine your sales stages
What are the sequential steps your sales reps will go through as they manage their opportunities?
Define when an opportunity will be created
When a Lead is qualified, when does a sales rep create an opportunity?
Next is building your sales process.
We’ve given you some background.
You should have a common framework or a common language to manage the Sales Activities that drive sales performance.
You will want to identify the decision steps along the way that indicate when an opportunity should be created and then how to manage the sales process.
How you sell should determine how you configure salesforce.
At what point do you want your sales reps to create an opportunity?
That’s one of the first things that you should decide.
<Animation 1> Next, what are the sales stages you use, the defaults in salesforce can be changed to map to your process so what are the stages, that’s for you to decide and configure
<Animation 2> After your sales stages, make sure you identify how and what you will track for reporting and analysis.
<Animation 3> And then finally, you will map your sales process to salesforce functionality to complete your solution.
Use the Getting Started workbook to help with this mapping.
Qualification
Best Practice:
Define your sales process
Getting Started Workbook
Qualification
Discovery
Proposal
Negotiation
Won/Lost
{}My Sales Stage (SAMPLE){}
Stages
Enter this stage when:
Lead
Individual is not a current customer and interest is not confirmed
Qualification
Individual has been contacted and expressed interest
Discovery
Interactions to understand individual needs for a particular deal are in progress
Proposal
Proposal/quote is getting developed
Negotiation
Individual has proposal and has not made decision
Closed- Won/Lost
Individual accepts/rejects proposal
Here is a typical sales process from lead to closed won or lost.
<Animations >:
1) Your first contact with many customers will be as a lead.
Once qualified, they move to
2) Discovery, understanding timing, budget, who approves, products/services the customer is interested in, etc.
3) Next, you’ll probably prepare the initial quote or proposal
4) After that most deals will run through a negotiation process
5) Finally, you will mark the deal as closed won or lost
<Animation>You not only can adjust the stage names within Salesforce, you may also add or remove stages to align to your sales process.
Your opportunity stage values are one of the first things you should adjust in salesforce.
Your stages should reflect your sales process rather than the salesforce defaults.
We’ve provided recommended stages and definitions in the Getting Started workbook.
Take the time to agree on these stages within your organization, then adjust Salesforce to match your process.

{}Convert Lead{}
{}Speaker1:{}
Now that you know what the salesforce objects are that are involved in your sales processes, let’s talk about the end to end sales process.
<animation 1> Typically, an organization will bring interested prospects in by creating a lead
<animation 2> Next you’ll gather information about that lead
<animation 3> Eventually you may disqualify that lead, if it isn’t the right fit or does not have the potential for a sale
<animation 4> If you discover this is a qualified lead, one that you want to move into a formal sales process, you will convert that prospect to an account and contact with an opportunity.
You’ll have various activities along the way as you work with that customer
<animation 5> Ultimately, you’ll monitor and track the sales process along the way to either a won or lost opportunity
What you will want to discover are the decision points that occur during a sales cycle and map out these processes.
Create a seamless user experience
{}Speaker1 (if two speakers, Speaker2):{}
Simplifying the salesforce screens and layout makes the entire rollout of salesforce successful for your organization.
We are going to share some simple best practices that have a huge impact on adoption by your users.
What’s great about salesforce is how much you can easily configure.
Best Practice:
Modify Standard Fields
Define the adjustments to standard fields
Hide unnecessary fields <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;074051&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />and related lists
Set required fields
Update pick list values
Set default values
Utilize help text to <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;074051&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />guide users
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;002044&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Help & Training:
</fill-sd><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;00A1E0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><lnk-c val="&lt;a:hlinkClick r:id=&quot;rId5&quot;/&gt;">What’s the difference between standard and custom fields</lnk-c></fill-sd>
Standard Fields in salesforce were designed to be flexible, and leave a lot of room for you to customize them and make them more useful to your instance.
Here’s a few things you can do to make standard fields work for you:
Use the Getting Started workbook to view the standard fields for the core sales objects.
We’ve provided a checklist for the recommended standard field changes within the workbook.
Let me walk through this checklist to give you some pointers.
Determine what adjustments you want to make to the fields to align to your business.
Fields that are not applicable to your business should be hidden to minimize data entry for your users and to avoid confusion.
Set required fields for fields that drive any reporting or processes.
Update pick list values so that the values shown in your dropdown are applicable.
This helps to minimize scrolling for your end users when entering data and helps to improve data quality.
Set default values where relevant.
It is common to set stages to default to the first stage.
And, finally, utilize help text for key fields where your users could benefit from additional guidance.
We recommend adding help text to your opportunity stage field to define each stage criteria.
This helps improve data quality and to minimize the questions you may receive from users when they start to use Salesforce.
Best Practice:
Add Custom Fields
Define custom fields needed
Add custom fields
Understand the value of formula fields
Leverage data types available
Adjust field location
Create validation rules (as appropriate)
Help & Training:
Creating Custom Fields
To tailor salesforce to fit your unique requirements, you can add custom fields for each of the tabs and objects that your organization uses.
There are several types of fields you can create, like a checkbox, a date field, and a text field.
Your Salesforce edition type will determine the amount of custom fields you can create.
After you have analyzed your needs, create the custom fields you will need to hold the data your team needs to enter
Utilize formula fields where possible, fields derived from other values.
An example would be bringing the account type down to the opportunity so you can see the account type on the opportunity but you don’t need to enter it.
Spend some time understanding the different data types available for custom fields, it is important you choose the right data type, text, currency, number, etc.
Another tip is to consider field location.
You want fields to be shown in the order the user will typically enter the data.
Group relevant fields together and keep your most important, required fields towards the top of the page.
Finally, as appropriate, you should consider creating validation rules.
These help to enforce data required based on other information entered.
For example, you would not want to allow a deal to move to closed-lost without capturing the loss reason.
We’ve provided some common custom fields for consideration in the Getting Started workbook.
Best Practice:
Organize your pages
Change field locations
Create new sections
Use meaningful section headers
Customize related lists
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;002060&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Help & Training:
</fill-sd><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;00A1E0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><lnk-c val="&lt;a:hlinkClick r:id=&quot;rId3&quot;/&gt;">Customizing Page Layouts with the Enhanced Page Layout Editor</lnk-c></fill-sd>
Let’s go over page layouts in detail.
A page layout allows you to arrange fields on the pages for each object in a particular order.
Page layouts control:
The layout and organization of Detail and Edit pages
Which fields, custom links, and related lists users see
Which standard and custom buttons display on detail pages and related lists.
And whether fields are visible, read only, or required.
Here are the steps we recommend:
Change field locations to have them make sense
Create new sections
Make sure you use meaningful section headers.
Customize related lists so you see the fields people want to see
One thing to note, for our Contact Manager, Group Edition, and Professional Edition customers, every user views the same layout.
Enterprise and above editions can create different page layouts for use by different profiles and record types, and set field-level security settings to further restrict users’ access to specific fields.
Best Practice:
Adapt Search Fields
Ensure relevant fields are returned in search
<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;002060&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">Help & Training:
</fill-sd><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;00A1E0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><lnk-c val="&lt;a:hlinkClick r:id=&quot;rId5&quot;/&gt;">Search Layouts</lnk-c></fill-sd>
This setup in salesforce is important for usability for your users and often overlooked!
Search layouts allow you to select the standard and custom fields that are displayed in salesforce’s search features.
This is a must-do to setup for each object in salesforce, don’t just use the defaults!
You are ensuring user adoption by testing their experience.
Validate your solution
Build a test scenario for your processes
Provide a test environment
Test your business processes
{}Speaker1 (if two speakers, Speaker2):{}
Once these configuration steps are done in your org, please go back to that team of testers you identified and have them validate your solutions.
Utilize your sandbox for validation or a test user you have set up in your production org.
Demonstration presented on new Lightning Experience
We recently launched a new user interface called the Lightning experience.
This interface is primarily focused on making sales users more productive through enhanced ease of navigation, data entry, and usability.
When you log in to your salesforce instance, do you see a vertical navy bar displaying icons running down the left side of the screen?
If yes, you are on the new Lightning experience.
This video demonstration will be shown using the new lightning environment, but we also offer a video for customers still on our Classic user interface.
Classic Experience
If you log on to salesfore and instead see a horizontal row of tabs across the top of your screen, then you are on Salesforce Classic.
Classic Experience – Demo & Set-up Series
Create the User Experience - Demo
Set-up Salesforce Series
Deciding If Lightning Experience is Right For You
For our Salesforce Classic customers, <animation 1>we have the same demonstration in our “Classic” environment.
To access, navigate to the right side of this video screen to expose the additional chapters of the series.
Scroll down and look for the video chapter labeled as ‘Classic Demo’.
<animation 2> We also have our Set-up Salesforce series.
We created demonstration videos where saleforce experts guide you through completing baseline customization tasks, such as setting up users or leads.
After watching the demonstration, you can access a step by step walkthrough which takes you directly in to your instance of salesforce to perform the task.
These walkthroughs are not currently supported in our new lightning experience user interface, but accessible in Classic.
All customers can enable or disable the lightning experience for their salesforce instance.
For more information on the lightning and classic user interfaces, we encourage customers to take a look at our Trailhead resource entitled Deciding If Lightning Experience Is Right for You.

Key considerations when importing and managing your data
{}Speaker2:{}
Let’s first begin with understanding the resources and tools to help you implement salesforce.
Importing your data:
Overview
Data Import Video Series
List your data sources and the names of the fields in which data is stored
{}Outlook{}
{}ACT{}
{}Legacy CRM{}
{}Gmail{}
{}Excel{}
{}Export File{}
Analyze and identify any potential problems <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;2000&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />with your data
Resolve issues and cleanse the data prior to import into salesforce
{}Speaker2:{}
To start, you need to identify what data you want to migrate, and understand where the data is coming from.
Common data repositories are legacy CRM systems, email, or excel spreadsheets.
<Animation 1> Data from these systems can be exported into a Comma-separated value format.
<Animation 2>
First, you need to identify the data you want migrate and understand the field names and properties of the data.
<Animation 3> Next, analyze the data and ask yourself and the team some key questions:
Do all records need to be migrated?
For example, do you plan to migrate old activities or archive them?
Does the data need to be cleaned or modified?
Have you removed duplicates?
<Animation 4>
Remember, dirty data in means dirty data out.
Be thoughtful and analyze the data you decide to import.
Take the time to resolve any issues with your import file to ensure you migrate a clean data set into Salesforce.
We highly encourage you to view the Data Import Series, which is located in the resources section of this video.
This 5 part video series covers in detail ways to clean your import file, prepare the file for upload, and prepare salesforce to receive the data.

{}Speaker2:{}
Once you’re ready to begin importing data, realize that it isn’t necessary to import all of your data at the same time.
We recommend you start with the foundations that allow you to be up and running
<animation1> Accounts and contacts should be your first phase.
<animation2>In addition, any “open” records that may need action should be imported, like open opportunities or leads.
<animation3> You likely want to provide visibility of past actions associated with your account and contact records.
For these historical records, like closed opportunities or cases, import this data based on your reporting needs.
<animation4> You can archive any data that doesn’t need to live in salesforce and keep it for future reference if needed.
<animation 5> and finally, always run small test files for every import!
Load 5-10 records as a test run to ensure the import runs smoothly.

Duplicates are a major issue for many customers.
Not only does it mean work for the administrator to clean up, but it makes it difficult for your users to find the right information.
(1) Here is a common example.
We see Grand Hotels & Resorts listed as Limited and as LTD.
This would create two unique account records for what should be one account.
Bad data impacts user productivity and hurts the credibility of the system.
Gaining the trust of your user is critical for adoption, and providing good data is a big part of that trust.
Take the time to clean and remove duplicates prior to import.
(2) The Data Import series has a video dedicated to help guide you through cleaning up your import file.
Prepare for import and data import tools
{}Speaker2:{}
Now, let’s discuss how to prepare for the import and introduce the data import tools available.
Prepare your import file
Prepare your files to facilitate the import process.
‘Preparing Your Data for Import’ Article
{}Checklist{}
Use Salesforce field names
Include the record owner ID
Populate required fields
Use valid picklist values
Include an import batch field
Add Created By and Created Date fields
Include legacy system data ID
{}Speaker2:{}
Importing your data requires you to prepare your import files.
The file you plan to import into salesforce is called your source file.
Once you’ve removed duplicates, you’ll want to prepare your source file to help make the import process run smoothly.
Here’s a quick checklist:
Rename the columns in your file to match Salesforce field names.
Be sure to include a column for record owner ID, as records imported will need be assigned to a user in your system
Make sure to populate data for all of your required fields.
If you’re importing a picklist field , make sure all the picklist values match those available in Salesforce.
It can be very helpful to associate records to a specific source file, especially when you’re doing multiple imports.
Create a new field called ‘import batch’ and assign it a value tied to your source file.
This allows you to easily select imported records from a particular batch in case you need to delete, re-import, or simply identify where the data originally came from.
Add Created By and Created Date fields
You can also include the legacy ID for each record.
This is a useful way to tie your legacy data from another CRM system to salesforce.
For additional help, review the Preparing your Data for Import article within the help and training portal.
We'll include a direct link
within our resources link below this video.

‘<lnk-c val="&lt;a:hlinkClick r:id=&quot;rId3&quot;/&gt;">Preparing Your Data for Import’ Article</lnk-c>
{}Checklist{}

Add valid picklist values
Add a field for legacy system data ID
Open Created By and Created Date fields<br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />(open a case with Salesforce support for access)
Use formula fields when possible
{}Speaker2:{}
You’ll also want to make sure your Salesforce application is ready for the import.
Make sure all the fields you need to migrate from your source file are available in Salesforce.
Here’s a quick checklist:
Identify your required fields.
Create custom fields in salesforce as needed if none of the standard fields map to the data you’re importing.
Add or edit picklist values so they match the data in your source file.
If you’re migrating data from a legacy CRM system, make sure to create a custom field to store this legacy ID within Salesforce.
When you create new records, salesforce automatically sets the create date to the current date and the created by field is the user doing the import.
If you are importing from another CRM system, you’ll likely want to preserve the original record creator and creation date for this legacy data.
To do this, contact salesforce support and request to have the audit fields feature enabled.
This will allow you to override the default behavior and import records with their original Created By and Creation Dates.
This only works on record creation and not while  updating records.
Remember to use formula fields as well to avoid duplicate data entry
Data Import Wizard
Use the Data Import Wizard when:
You are loading fewer than <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />50,000 records
The object you need to import is supported by the Data Import Wizard
You want to prevent duplicates for Accounts, Contacts, Leads
Data Import Video Series
{}Speaker2:{}
We’ve shared how to prepare your source file and salesforce for the import.
Now, we’ll share two main tools salesforce offers for completing a one-time import of your data , The Data Import Wizard and the Data Loader.
The Data Import Wizard is run through the application and here are a few things to consider to decide which tool best fits your needs.
The import wizard is best used when working with smaller data loads, less than 50,000 records.
Make sure the objects you need to import  are supported by the data import wizard
We recommend using the Data Import Wizard to import Account and Contact data, as it is able to prevent duplicates from being created.
View the Data Import Series for additional guidance on Choosing the right tool.

Data Loader
‘Deciding on A Method for Importing Data’ Article
Data Import Video Series
Use Data Loader* when:
You need to import 50,000 to 5,000,000 records
You need to load into an object that <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />is not supported by the import wizards
You want to schedule regular <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />data loads
You want to export your data for backup purposes
{}Speaker2:{}
The second tool is called The Data Loader which is an API-based tool.
Here are some highlights of the tool:
The data loader is best used for importing large volumes of data (50,000 and more).
It’s commonly used to load data for objects not supported by the Data Import Wizards
The data loader also has the ability to schedule regular data loads
And the ability to export data for back up purposes.
The Data loader is available for Enterprise, Unlimited and Performance edition customers by default, and can be enabled for Professional edition customers when necessary for your implementation.
Contact support to have the data loader feature turned on.
Be sure to view the Data Import Series and our knowledge base article on Deciding on a method for importing data.

A quick overview of a data import
Using Gmail as a source for an Accounts/Contact import file
I will discuss a few common issues that create duplicate Accounts during the data import process
Then I will demonstrate using the Data Import Wizard to import Accounts with Contacts and I will discuss a best practices around importing your Accounts and Contacts
{}Exporting data from data sources (Gmail contacts):{}
-Open browser to your Gmail’s Contacts section
-Show the Business Contacts folder that will have specific group of contacts to import into salesforce.
-Above the Contact list click More > Export > select “The Group ( Contact Folder  )” and specify folder
-Select Export format Outlook CSV as it is the easiest format to work with.
This will create a file that I will use for the import.
{}CSV File preparation best practices:{}
-Export the gmail contacts and open the .csv file
-Remove columns with no data or data your not going to import and just basically explain that any external system (eg. Gmail, linkedin, goldmine) can export data out to .csv format.
{}Open a sample .CSV file:{}
{}-{}Show/Explain Batch id field in column A, using the current date as a unique value.
“This is the field that I will use to relate an imported record to the import file this record originated from.
Here is the prepared file with the fields removed and the Batch ID column added.
-Explain each column and what type of field is being populated.
-Quick tip:
Mention Excel has a “Remove Duplicates” option and how it can be used
-Show Account duplicates “Grand Hotels & Resorts Ltd” & “Limited” and explain that two different records will not be created but 2 new contacts (John and Sam) will be created (Sample csv file: http://sforce.co/1Fq8D9l)
{}Ready for import of Accounts and Contacts using Data Import Wizard (DIW):{}
-Setup> Data Management > Data Import wizard (DIW)
-Data Import video series can be accessed right from the DIW page.  (review before starting)
-Click Launch Wizard and then select Accounts and Contacts > Add New records
Match Contacts by:
Email   ,   Match Account by:
Account Name & Account Site  (keep Trigger Workflows..
Unchecked)
Select CSV and Browse or Drag sample CSV to the wizard > Next
Map necessary fields including “Unique Batch” with “Account:
Import Batch” > Next
Click Start Import > OK
Explain the Bulk Load results page
Go to Accounts Tab and open “Today’s Accounts” List view and show all the new accounts/contact that were imported.
Explain why “sForce” and “Grand Hotels & Resorts Limited” was not imported as a dupes due to the match rule settings.
{}Mass Delete Accounts / Contacts:{}
In case your import had all errors you might want to back track and delete the records so you can use the Mass Delete tool.
Account Tab > Tools section > Mass Delete Accounts and show how to Mass Delete Today’s accounts based on the unique Import Batch field value as a criteria
Go through and Delete all the accounts (this will also delete the related Contact records)
{}Demo alternate Tool – Import Accounts/Contacts:{}
First explain the difference of when you’d use DIW vs. Import Accounts/Contacts vs. Data Loader.
(Send audience this link from Help & Training to show the limits of each import tool: https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=import_which_data_import_tool.htm&language=en_US)
{}Difference:{}
{}DIW – Up to 50,000 records (Admins can use for initial load) , Import My Accounts & Contacts – Up to 500 records (mainly for importing personal contacts){}
-Setup > Data Management > Import Accounts/Contacts > Start the Import Process
-Select Generic CSV Format as source but explain that other sources including Outlook, Gmail, Linkedin, Mail Chimp, Zoho, Yahoo Mail!, Act! etc. can be used.
{}{}** IMPORTANT NOTE:{}{}
{}{}Prohibit customers {}{}from selecting GMAIL as a source because it does not allow them to differentiate between their personal and business contacts so it will import everything
-Upload CSV file (Sample csv file: http://sforce.co/1Fq8D9l)
Map necessary fields including “Unique Batch” with “Import Batch” > Begin Import
Go back to Accounts Tab and open “Today’s Accounts” List view and show all the new accounts/contact that were imported.

Good Data Management
‘<lnk-c val="&lt;a:hlinkClick r:id=&quot;rId3&quot;/&gt;">Validation Rule Article</lnk-c>
{}Speaker1:{}
During Chapter 1, we shared the importance of migrating clean data into salesforce.
(1) Once it's imported, you need a strong data management strategy to make sure the data stays clean and up to date.
The first step is to train your users to enter clean data with simple and easily repeatable steps.
Here are a few tips:
(2) Train your users to input quality data
(3 ) Standardize your data by using naming & address conventions
(4) And Prevent duplicates by making sure users search for records before creating new ones that may already exist in your database.
(5) Another aspect of good data management is enforcing the right behavior through configuration in salesforce.
There are a number of good customization options including:
(6)  The ability to create fields that are required on the page layout
(7) Using  picklist fields versus open text fields to give users a defined set of data points to choose from
(8) And using Validation rules to verify that the data a user enters in a record meets the standards you specify before that record can be saved.
A validation rule can be a formula or expression that checks the data and displays an error message to the user if the data entered doesn’t match what you want it to be.
(9) The help & traning portal has useful articles on validiation rules, including example rules and formulas you can utilize.
We included links to these assets within the resources document which you can download directly below this video.

Best Practice:
Archive and Back up
{}Data Archive{}
Data you will not migrate
Storage plan for  import files
Data you will archive in Salesforce
{}Data Back up{}

Data back up options available on the  AppExchange
‘Exporting Backup Data’ Article
{}Speaker1:{}
There are 2 additional best practices we would like to share, Archiving data and Backing up your data.
<animation 1>
We recommend developing a plan around how and when you will archive data.
Before the initial import, decide what data will not be imported and archive that data in case you need to reference it in the future.
Next, have a plan for storing your import files.
And as you think about maintaining your data over time, decide if you will develop a plan to archive data that lives within salesforce.
Often customers remove leads after a certain period of time or activities older than X number of years.
<animation>
We also encourage you to develop a plan to back up your data to make sure you are protected from any internal mistakes that may occur.
We recommend performing a weekly export of your data.
Or, if you run a data project in the future, be sure to back up your data before you start.
Here are a few options to export your data:
The weekly export service is available for Enterprise edition customers and above.
This service allows organizations to export a complete set of their salesforce data including all attachments for archival purposes.
A system administrator can request a data export once every seven (7) days.
For our Professional edition customers, you can purchase this weekly export service for an additional fee.
Another option is to generate key data reports in salesforce and export to a CSV file.
This can be an effective backup for customers who do not have the weekly export service.
And Other options are available from third party partners on the Appexchange.
For more information, Review the help and training article around Exporting backup data.

Developing valuable reports & dashboards
{}Speaker1:{}
Now let’s discuss developing valuable reports and dashboards.
Better insight
Actionable data
Better decisions
Reporting as a monitoring and decision making tool
{}Speaker1:{}
Reporting is a great way to see how you or your company is performing.
However, we recommend you take this a step further and develop a strategic approach to generating actionable data, which can used to make decisions that specifically target performance improvements.
Here’s an example of actionable data:
If you’re company is losing business to competitors, it’s critical to know who, how often, and why.
Track these key data points in salesforce and require your reps to fill out the competitor name and reason lost whenever they lose to a competitor.
You then report on that data to give you the insights you need to adjust your competitive strategy.
If you find out that 70% of your competitive losses involve one specific company, or the primary reason for loss is that they got to the prospect first, you may want dedicate more budget and resources to uncover better leads and develop sales and marketing materials to help your sales representatives be more successful when up against that competitor.
STANDARD REPORTS
CUSTOM REPORTS
Out-of-the-box reports
Can be built from scratch
Stored in standard folders
Can be created from standard reports
Can be customized
Must be saved in a custom, personal, or unfiled folder
Cannot be deleted from the standard report folders
Can be overwritten or deleted
Use Prebuilt Reports
Reports are lists or summaries that allow you to aggregate and analyze your data in different ways.
Reports and Dashboards quickstart
{}Speaker1:{}
Now, let’s talk about some ways to get you up and running with reports and dashboards quickly.
Salesforce provides a rich collection of prebuilt, out of the box standard reports that you can tailor to fit your needs.
Standard reports are available for most objects, including opportunities, accounts, contacts, and administrative reports.
You can start with a standard report, then customize it to fit your requirements and save it as a new report.
These standard reports are always available as a starting point, and they can not be deleted from your standard report folders.
There are many standard reports available so you’ll rarely need to create a brand-new report, especially in the beginning stages of your implementation.
But as you get more comfortable with Salesforce and your reporting requirements evolve, explore some of the custom reporting options.
Benefits include the ability to create the report from scratch, you can start with a standard report and customize as needed, and you can save these reports in a custom, personal, or unfiled folder.
One note of caution.
Custom reports can be overwritten or deleted to those who have access, so make sure users are trained to ‘save as’ modifying a custom report.

Use Prebuilt Dashboards
Prebuilt, best practice Reports & Dashboards
Completely customizable
Dashboards for Executives, Managers, Reps
Example dashboards include:
Sales
Marketing
Service
Salesforce CRM Dashboards from the AppExchange
Rule of thumb:
In general, if you can see the data, you can report on it.
{}Speaker1:{}
Use our prebuilt dashboards.
Again, we make it easy.
Dashboards are powerful analytic tools, giving you a combined graphical view of data from multiple reports.
To help get you started with them, we have a great dashboard pack available on the AppExchange that contains key dashboards for sales, marketing and support roles, and even for measuring login and adoption in your system.
This is a fast, easy way not only to measure success in your system, but to get dashboards that follow best practices.
Best Practices for Analytics Development
{}Make the data relevant to the audience - {}Think about the audience for the dashboard or report.
{}Group data logically – use space wisely:{}
A well-designed dashboard or report  will ensure that data is displayed in logical groups.
Present only the most important data.
{}Speaker1:{}
Here are some best practices to think of when designing your reports and dashboards:
Dashboards should be designed with the end user in mind.
Know the reason behind the dashboard and what needs are being met.
The physical layout of the dashboard makes a difference.
I tell people to tell a story with a dashboard.
Use the rows and columns logically and use titles and subtitles to help tell the story.
Remember, people read left to right, top to bottom.
The left hand top component occupies a key location on your dashboard, use that to your advantage.
Use footers to support the story, it is where you can put the question being answered by the component.

Success – Getting Started:
Q&A
{}Speaker1:{}
Let’s see what questions you have asked using the Go To Webinar question widget.
{}Use GTW widget….{}
Demonstration (Optional)
Require a field on a page layout
Create a Validation Rule
Create a formula field
{}Speaker1:{}
{}Demo script – LEX UI:{}
Next I am going to show three simple features that we recommend to help your users input accurate data:
How to set a field as required when creating a salesforce record
How to require a field based upon another value in a record, these are called “Validation Rules”
Finally, how to create a formula field where you expose a field from the account object to a child object, in this case, the opportunity
{}Require a field on a page layout:{}
Now I am going to show you some simple features you can use in your salesforce configuration to ensure accurate quality data entry by your end users.
Our first recommended configuration step is to make sure you set fields to required if they should be entered when a new record is created.
This is a very simple configuration.
Gear Icon > Setup Home > Objects & Fields > Object Manager > Account > Page Layouts > Edit page layout > Edit a field to show how it is made required (explain how this improves data quality but not to go overboard with it)
{}Validation Rules:{}
Next, I want to take you through the process of creating a validation rule.
In this case, I want to make sure that if a sales representative is marking an opportunity as “Closed Lost”, they fill in the custom field we have created for the Closed Lost Reason.
Opportunities Tab > Open existing opportunity.
Show that you cannot make an opportunity Closed Lost unless you have the field “Loss Code” populated with a loss reason.
Gear Icon > Setup Home > Objects & Fields > Object Manager > Opportunity > Validation Rules > Edit rule “Closed Loss Rule“ and explain briefly how it was set up.
{}Formula Field:{}
Finally, let me show you a useful tip on how to display a key field from the Account object down to the child record like the Opportunity without the user having to enter the data in the Opportunity.
-View Opportunity record and show Account Type field
Setup:
- Gear Icon > Setup Home > Objects & Fields > Object Manager > Opportunity > Fields > select New > select a formula field > Type Text field > Next
-Use the advanced formula screen > Insert field, select the Account object with the carrot and then select the Type field.
-Use TEXT Text function to convert the picklist to a text value – here is the formula:
Text(Account.Type )

Select the best way to train your users
{}Speaker1:{}
One of the most important things you and your team can do is establish a training program for your users.
You will need to emphasize the value of training, develop the process you’ll use to deliver training, create your training materials and plans and ensure your management teams support your training program.
Set the stage
Answer “{}What's in it for me?{}”
Tell your users what they can expect from Salesforce and what is expected of them.
Be clear to users how success is measured
Establish “{}If it isn't in Salesforce, it does not exist{}”
{}Speaker1:{}
Your training strategy will include the training objectives and delivery schedule.
It should also include insight into your business objectives and value.
Start with helping your users understand what is expected of them and what they can expect in turn.
{}<animation1>{}Your executive and management teams should drive home the message that “if doesn’t exist in salesforce it doesn’t exist”.
This will help users understand that data quality and completeness is a priority.
{}<animation2>{} Help them understand what metrics are being used by their managers in salesforce to measure success.
{}<animation3>{} And Make sure you sell the value of what users will achieve with salesforce by articulating the “What’s in it for me” for the end user.
If you make it easy for your users to use your solution, establish clear expectations, provide insight into benefits to the business, and explain “what’s in for me” then you have set the stage for success.

{}Speaker1:{}
Here are 3 steps to consider when planning your training:
{}<animation1>{}First, you need to identify your audience
{}<animation2>{}Second, determine relevant user scenarios specific to your audience
{}<animation3>{}And third, define the types of training you will offer, and when and how they will be delivered
Let’s discuss in more detail.
Identify your audience
Who needs to be trained?
What processes are relevant for the audience?
What scenarios are covered by Salesforce?
Key Questions:
Activity Tracking
Reports & Dashboards
Sales Process
Account & Contact Management
{}Training Areas{}
{}Sales Rep{}
{}Sales Manager{}
{}Executive{}
Leads Process
{}Speaker1:{}
Knowing your audience is critical to the success of training.
Different kinds of users will have distinct goals and perform different tasks in Salesforce.
Focus your training based on their role and create training scenarios that are relevant to their day to day.
For example, (1) train your management team separate from your end users, since they will interact with the application in very different ways.
Determine your scenarios
Prep for meeting with prospect – review account, contact and activity history
Capture meeting outputs – update opportunity and set follow-up activities
Use Salesforce1 to capture the information when on the road
<font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{}SAMPLE</font><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans Light&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;Salesforce Sans Light&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;">{} “{}Day in the Life{}” Sales Rep Scenario:</font>
{}Speaker1:{}
Your training will be more effective if you include scenarios.
These are typical processes your users will go through on a daily basis using Salesforce.
Here is an example of a scenario for a sales representative as they go through their day.
Our sales representative is meeting with a prospective customer.
Your training will show them how to use Salesforce to look up relevant information to prep for the meeting.
Once the meeting ends, it will include steps on how to capture meeting outputs, like updating an open opportunity and scheduling a follow up task.
Also, if the sales rep is on the road, walk through how they can perform the same activities using the Salesforce1 mobile application.

Here is an example of an ideal training path for your sales representatives.
{}<animation1>{}First, we utilize the basic Getting Started modules from salesforce to familiarize your users with the system and learn the terminology.
These self paced courses can be helpful as pre-requisite training before attending live training.
{}<animation2>{} Next is in-person training where you go through real business processes in your salesforce solution.
Create training in shorter sessions to keep focused on a specific scenario or topic.
If applicable,  h<fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;dk1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;">ave users enter “real” data not just test data.
Communicate in advance that they should come prepared to training with information they want to enter.</fill-sd>
{}<animation1>{} Finally, do ad hoc follow-up training sessions to provide ongoing training based on feedback provided from your users.
These can be done as brown bags, web-based meetings, emails or in person sessions.

First, salesforce releases new versions three times a year.
Build time into your training program to review the new release and provide training to your end users as needed for new features you wish to enable.
Second, use Chatter to communicate self serve training materials to your end users
Third, develop a train the trainer program so key users take ownership of training new users within their work groups
Fourth, training should happen throughout the year so build an ongoing training process for new users and for existing users.
And finally, develop a process to track end user training.
This way, you can refer users back to the training plan if they missed a step or have questions.

Administering Salesforce”.
We also offer comprehensive instructor led training courses regionally and virtually at an additional cost.
Afterward, take the exam to earn your salesforce certification.
{}<animation2>{}  Visit our Salesforce University page to learn more about certification.
{}<animation3>{} We also encourage you to join a local user group.
These groups are run by customers who want to network and connect with customers, partners, and administrators in their area.
Look for a local user group near you within the success community.
{}<animation4>{}And join other groups within the Success Community to get connected and learn from salesforce experts.
Support, engage, and motivate your users
{}Speaker1:{}
After users are trained, the next step is to support them, keep them engaged and drive adoption.
The methods you emphasize will naturally depend on your organization’s unique culture.
Let’s talk through some examples.
Drive User Adoption
Executive leadership
Emphasize the value
Motivate by recognition
Develop incentives
{}Motivate{}
{}Support{}
{}Engage{}
Utilize super users
Document your support process and share
Address problems quickly and publicly
Offer refresher training
Develop a communication plan
Create feedback loops
Reach out to resistors
Utilize Chatter
Walk the floor
{}Speaker1:{}
What motivates your users will be unique to your organization but there are common themes we want to share to help drive end user adoption.
{}<animation1>{}
Motivating the team is led by management, and the executive sponsor needs to be engaged throughout the deployment, not just at the beginning.
Keep them involved and communicating the value of using salesforce.
This is a big factor for success.
Continue to articulate the “what’s in it for me” to your users.
As your deployment evolves and you introduce new features or enhancements, each should include the value for the end user.
Some users are very motivated by recognition.
Use adoption dashboards to create a Hall of Fame and highlight users who are actively logging into Salesforce.
Other users are motivated by rewards.
Think about user contests or other ways to provide incentives.
{}<animation2>{}
Once users are live on salesforce, you should develop a support process to provide users a way to get help and ask questions.
Develop and utilize your super users.
These users understand the business processes and are passionate about the value of using salesforce.
Make them an extension of you and a resource to help other users with questions.
Create, document and communicate a support process for your users so they know who to contact and when.
If you have Premier, think about exposing your premier passcode and support number to your users right on the home page and extending that support channel to them.
Level set with your users that is purely for technical help.
Address issues or problems quickly and publically.
Communicate to your users if an issue is discovered, and share when the issue is resolved.
Finally, offer ongoing training and use the frequently asked questions from your support process to identify the topics for training.
We recommend small informal sessions and consider recording and posting them in a shared library based on topic.
{}<animation3>{}
And continue to connect and engage with your users.
Develop and share your ongoing communication plan including upcoming training sessions, milestones, or functional roadmap items you have based on feedback received.
Create a feedback loop so when you receive a suggestion, you have a way to share progress and priority.
We discussed resistors in our first session, who are those users that resist change.
They have great information to share to improve your solution, reach out to them.
We recommended the user of a chatter group to communicate and collect feedback during the launch of salesforce, but utilize this ongoing.
It’s a great way to engage with users within salesforce.
And finally, walk the floor and sit with your users as they are performing their day to day tasks.
Watching go through the motions will help you understand what is working and what is not working.
Best Practice:
Use Chatter to accelerate training and adoption

Increase transparency
Celebrate achievements
Showcase super users, MVP’s or early adopters
On-board and mentor employees
{}Speaker1:{}
As we shared earlier, Chatter is a great tool to help deliver training and an environment for engagement
{}<animation1>{}
We recommend using a Chatter to make training easier to deliver and to give users a place to ask questions, participate in conversations and provides an announcement capability to your trainers.
Use Chatter to:
Consolidate training materials
House training schedules and announcements
Connect your users
Provide a space for conversations
Share best practices and how to’s
{}<animation2>{}
Use Chatter as a tool for feedback and user engagement with you and each other
Chatter provides a method for executives to reinforce the value
Chatter provides transparency to crucial information in the application
It allows you to celebrate company, team and individual achievements
And you can also on-board and mentor new employees into your company with Chatter
Creating a Chatter group is an effective way to share important dates and deadlines, provides a central place to store training documents, and allow users to share feedback.
It is the single easiest way to provide a training and feedback environment right in the application for your users.

Track and measure success
{}Speaker2:{}
Part of your implementation plan is how to measure the success of your deployment when you Go Live with your users.
Let’s go into more detail and discuss the tools that will help you.
Best Practice:
Measure Salesforce usage
Adoption Dashboards from the AppExchange
Salesforce usage is a valuable metric for measuring success
{}Success Indicators:{}
Login rates
What data are they creating/updating?
{}Suggestions:{}
Opportunities created, last 30 days
Activities completed, last 30 days
Login rates, last 7 days
Users who haven’t logged in, last 7 days
{}Speaker2:{}
Once users are active on salesforce, usage metrics can provide value and insight into how users are interacting with the system.
Some early indicators of success include login rates and record creation or updates.
Login rates tracks how often users are logging in to salesforce, and record creation or record updates give you insight if users are interacting with the data.
{}<animation1> {}Your success metrics will differ depending on the expected behavior of your users, but here are a few suggested metrics to track:
- How many opportunities have been created in the last 30 days?
- How many activities were completed in the last 30 days?
- What is our login rate over the last 7 days?
- Who is logging in and, more importantly, who is not logging in and why?
Build out your adoption dashboards based on the expected pattern of usage you are aiming for and review these metrics at least once a month.
If you see usage is not progressing like you had hoped, it could be a sign that users need more assistance.
Perhaps additional training is necessary, or some users may need more one on one training if they are struggling.
Remember, you do not need to start from scratch.
Visit the appexchange and download the adoption dashboards which will provide metrics around usage and data creation.
{}<animation2> {}We will include a link to this dashboard in the resource file located below this video.
Best Practice:
Measure data quality
Salesforce Data Quality Dashboards from the AppExchange
Data quality is a valuable metric for measuring adoption
{}Examples:{}
Account Data Quality
Opportunities Data Quality
Missing Account Data
Sales Reps Opportunity Quality Scores
{}Speaker2:{}
Good data quality is another way to measure adoption.
Here are some examples of what you can track and the value of keeping an eye on this data.
During training, you emphasized the need to capture non-required key fields, however the dashboard is showing that a low percentage of those fields are completed.
Are users confused on what to do?
Did they miss the importance of capturing these data fields?
If you have data that is not progressing as expected, such as opportunities stuck in the same sales stage for too long or open deals with a close dates in the past, then users are not maintaining their data which tells you there is a problem.
Are there too many clicks?
Is data hard to find?
Are you unclear on the sales process?
Was there an assumption a process would be followed but there is no mandate to do so?
Having visibility into the data allows you to be proactive to uncover blockers that are impacting adoption.
Use this insight to help users
overcome challenges.
Visit the Appexchange and review the data quality dashboards available.
There are several, including Account and Opportunity data quality.
We will share the link to these dashboards in our resources deck directly below this video.
Best Practice:
Assess User Satisfaction
Survey tools on the AppExchange
User feedback will help you drive adoption
Are your end users finding Salesforce easy to use?
Are Sales Managers managing their teams more effectively?
Are Sales Reps finding content faster?
The appexchange has tools for surveys, check them out!
{}Speaker2:{}
After you have your usage and data quality analysis, the next step is to assess user satisfaction.
This type of measurement is usually done through a survey or formal business process review.
This direct feedback from users can help you understand if the pain points and business objectives are being realized.
This is a fast way for you to get feedback and make adjustments to your Salesforce solution as needed.
For our smaller organizations, you can explore using a Chatter group for feedback and consider creating some chatter polls to get insight.
Be sure to explore the AppExchange to review third party survey tools available.
Track achievement of business outcomes
{}Speaker2:{}
Are you achieving the business outcomes you had targeted?
Here is an example:
For a sales-driven company this may relate to the length of the sales cycle or win rates.
It is up to each individual company to decide which metrics they want to measure and which they are able to measure to understand how salesforce is affecting their business.
Let’s talk about some steps you can take to build these metrics in Salesforce.
What should you do now?
Start the discussion with your stakeholders
Implement the strategy
Build dashboards that highlight your <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;002044&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />key metrics
Start driving performance with actionable <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:srgbClr val=&quot;002044&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />data and dashboards!
Need a jumpstart?
Use the AppExchange
{}Speaker2:{}
So, where do you start?
If you haven’t already, use the business objectives and key metrics outlined in your Getting started workbook to guide your conversations with your stakeholders.
Schedule a meeting to review and discuss progress.
Implement a strategy around how to track achievements.
Remember, adoption and measurement will evolve over time, but you want to make sure you are tracking progress and taking action on insights to optimize your salesforce deployment.
Start simple but build out some key reports and dashboards and review them with management for feedback.
Make sure the reports and dashboards highlight actionable data so everyone sees the value.
And use the appexchange dashboard packs to get a jump start.

{}Speaker2:{}
The Getting Started Workbook has worksheets and examples to help you identify your business metrics.
Tailor the worksheet to document what is important to your company.
Outline key questions you want to answer, then associated it with a metric you can track in salesforce.
This gives you an action plan for the metrics you need to create.
Be sure to review the salesforce standard reports as well as the prebuilt dashboards on the AppExchange to help you build them.
Reports and Dashboards available on the AppExchange
100+ more reports and dashboards from partners to explore as you expand and grow your business.
Salesforce CRM Dashboards
Sales Activity Dashboards
Service and Support Dashboards
Salesforce Mobile Dashboard for iPad
{}Speaker2:{}
We’ve introduced the Adoption and Data quality dashboards available on the appexchange, but there are more.
These best practice dashboards were built by salesforce experts to help customers get visibility into common metrics tracked across our customer base.
Examples include
Salesforce CRM Dashboards, which includes Sales, Service, and Marketing dashboards
Sales Activity Dashboards
and mobile dashboards for your Ipad
Let’s share some best practices as you consider downloading these AppExchange dashboard packs:
You have the option to install the dashboard in your sandbox environment or in a developer org.
This will let you explore prior to installing in your production instance.
You have full control to customize these dashboards and the underlying reports to meet your business needs.
You can even delete if they do not fit your needs.
And finally, once the dashboards are ready, communicate the availability to your stakeholders for their review and feedback.
You may consider informal training sessions so people know how to use them.
Validate your solution
Ensure user adoption by testing their experience.
Is your training preparing your users?
Does your feedback process create engagement and trust?
Do your users feel supported?
Are you measuring the right <br val="&lt;a:br&gt;&lt;a:rPr sz=&quot;1800&quot;&gt;&lt;a:latin typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;a:cs typeface=&quot;Salesforce Sans&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:rPr&gt;&lt;/a:br&gt;" />business outcomes?
{}Speaker2:{}
Throughout our Getting started series, we’ve recommended that you validate your design and customizations with end users.
Continue this best practice to validate your training, support and engagement processes with end users as well.
Are you meeting your user’s needs?
Do they feel supported?
In addition, you will want to validate that the business dashboards you created meet their needs as well.
Make sure you do this validation and testing to drive a successful rollout.

Push notifications are visual indicators on lists and detail pages in a Salesforce console that show when a record or field has changed during a user’s session.
For example, if two support agents are working on the same case and one agent changes the Priority, a push notification displays to the other agent so he or she notices the change and doesn’t duplicate the effort.
This setup will highlight the update Case (row) in the Case List with a Yellow Highlight.
Ex:
{}Choose Push Notifications{}

Compact Case Feed
Responsive Sidebar Components
Inline Editing
“Self” Lookup Component

Console Panel Configuration
Overview of new settings/features in Winter ’15 SDO Console
Case Feed View
Standard Console Components
Related Account Mini Page Layout
Related Account Mini Page Layout
2.
Console Panel Configuration
Step 1 – Remove Case Feed Permission
Delete this Permission Set
Deleting this Permission Set allows us to utilize the “Case Page Layouts”, rather than the “Page Layouts for Case Feed Users”.
This gives us the ability to use the “Compact Case Feed”.
2.
Console Panel Configuration
Case Feed View
Edit this Page Layout
This will be the case page layout we use.
It also has the advantage of being the “New Case” page layout and being the Salesforce1 page layout.
2.
Case Feed View
Go into “Feed View”
This allows us to edit the feed view of the page layout
2.
Case Feed View
Check these boxes to turn on the full-width feed and the compact feed
Check this box to turn on the Publisher Auto Collapse
This turns on the full-width feed and the compact feed, which optimizes use of screen real estate
2.
Case Feed View
Set the Feed Filters to appear in a drop-down list in the center column
Add “Attached Articles” and “Live Chat Transcripts” to the selected filter
Don’t forget to SAVE!
Set the case feed filters and SAVE your work.
Use “Quick Save” on the page layout editor.
2.
Case Feed View
Remove all fields except for “Subject”
Key fields are being moved to the sidebar.
This is one option – do what is right for your situation.
After hitting “OK”, quick save your layout.
2.
Case Feed View
Edit Layout Properties
Uncheck “Knowledge Sidebar” and “Highlights Panel”
Click “Quick Save”
We’re going to use Knowledge One in the sidebar, so we don’t need this older version in the page layout.
Hit “OK” to save and then “Quick Save”.
2.
Console Panel Configuration
Standard Console Components
Click “Custom Console Components”
Let’s set up our new console
2.
Standard Console Components
Add “Milestones” and “Knowledge One” to the Right Sidebar
Add “This Case” and “Account Name” Lookups to Left Sidebar
Let’s take advantage of some new layout options to expose SLA status and Knowledge in the right sidebar and then details on the Case and related Account in tabs in the left sidebar.
This is powerful new functionality, so we recommend we try out some different options.
2.
Console Panel Configuration
Review Updated Console and Case Feed
Edit the detail data in the side panel directly
Compact Case Feed
Minimal Highlight Panel
Expand/Collapse All
New Milestone/Knowledge One Layout
Here’s our new layout.
Notice:
You can now edit data in the current record or related records directly from the side panel
You can collapse the case feed to save space and show more history
You can expand or collapse all by clicking one button
You now only see the Case Subject in the highlight panel
You can see the current milestone status and Knowledge in the right sidepanel
2.
Console Panel Configuration
If you are using an older SDO, you will need to perform all of the previous steps for each Case Page Layout you will be using in your demos
Primarily the “Converted” layouts
2.
Console Panel Configuration
Step 4 – Edit Related Account Mini Page Layout
Click “View” to View Account Page
Let’s go ahead and update our Account side panel to include the fields and related lists we want to see.
Click “View” to open the Account page in a new subtab.

Manage Complex Processes and Workflow with Entitlements
{}Efficient and on-time service delivery{}
Sales/Sales Operations - manage complex sales processes, manage sales deliverables
Services Engagements / Deployments / Implementation
Project Management - across all industries
Back-Office Processes – insurance claims, customer & employee on-boarding, etc.
Anything that follows a multi-stage process
Increased
Customer Satisfaction
Cost Reduction
One of the key differentiators with Service Cloud is the ability to create and manage Entitlements and Service Contracts.
* Entitlements allows customers to manage processes using pre-defined milestones.
We then surround those milestones with automated workflow - like a "Stop-Watch" -to help manage the process.
This is ALL done using Point-and-Click / Declarative configuration
* The most common use-case for Entitlements would be SLAs within a customer service environment.
This is often a huge pain-point; causing low CSAT and possibly SLA violation fees.
Service Contracts also give them the ability to SELL from the contact center.
Entitlements can also be used outside of support - use-cases include:
* Sales/Sales Operations - manage complex sales processes, manage sales deliverables
* Services Engagements / Deployments / Implementation
* Project Management - across all industries
* Back-Office Processes - Insurance Claims, Customer On-Boarding, etc, etc.
* Anything that follows a multi-stage process

Why Entitlements?

Service contracts can represent many types of business contracts including:  service level agreements, subscriptions, warranties, etc.
A service contract usually entitles end customer or partners to a specific type of service or support.
A service contract is an agreement between an end customer and one or more parties to deliver services and in some cases related products or features.
Service contracts are often made up of line items that specify the products, services, and assets to be covered under the terms of the contract.
Service Contracts are usually valid for a specific time period and include effective dates that determine if the contract is active.
Salesforce.com is used for customer support and to manage your customers’ service contracts based on line items in a service Contract
Your support team help manages service contract transactions, such as transfers, mergers, and renewals
Warranties, subscriptions, or other support products appear as line items on your sales orders and map to one or more entitlements
Entitlements are created and updated through an integration with your order management system

Solution Overview:
Salesforce Console and CTI
Spring ‘15 Release
Gautam Vasudev
This resource is intended for internal audiences only.
Do not share with customers.
Training resources will be made available for use with customers.
Also be aware that the content in this deck includes forward-looking statements.
Feature details and information are subject to change, and the Safe Harbor statement applies.
Responsive Sidebars – Min Width and Height
Often times users are prescribed a Console configuration by admins.
In such cases, depending on the users resolution, some components might not have enough space to render well.
In fact, some times there is such little space that the Console component might no longer be functional.
At this time it’s better to hide the component than display it.
In Spring ‘15, standard components ( all components except Visualforce and Canvas) have a minimum height and width.
If the space available to an agent is smaller than either, the component is hidden.
Collapse/Expand Sidebar:
Keyboard Shortcut And API
Often times Console sidebars are useful only at certain points in the Case resolution process.
Between this, agents might not need the sidebars.
Now sidebar regions can be collapsed and expanded with either a keyboard shortcut or a new Console toolkit method.
This means that a sidebar region’s visibility can now be tied to a field on a case.
By having a VF component in a sidebar, fields on the record can be inspected and the appropriate sidebar collapsed.
The user can always expand the sidebar manually or via a shortcut if needed.
Collapse/Expand Pinned List:
Keyboard Shortcut
Like Console sidebars, users use the Console Pinned List a fraction of the time they use the detail view.
In this case a keyboard shortcut allow a user to easily collapse the pinned list and gain all the real estate available in the Console.
However, it’s often useful to scan the list view quickly and view remaining items or reprioritize.
By having the shortcut toggle between the expand and collapse states, a user can quickly see, act on and collapse the list.
Provide brief product overview and summarize updates for the new release
Feature Overview
Zoom Keyboard Shortcut
Often times users have little real estate, and have to read data in a small space.
In the Console, the presence of the header, footer and pinned list often contribute to this.
In Spring ‘15, a Zoom (‘z’) keyboard shortcut instantly collapses the header, footer and pinned list to focus just on the user’s workspaces.
This has a great experience since now the user has a lot more real estate.
By hitting ‘z’ again, the user can unzoom or expand those components again.
Keyboard Shortcuts for Footer
Agents of love shortcuts, and anything that saves from having to pick up the mouse is helpful.
With the Console footer, many components are often sufficient to just peek at.
With Spring ’15, the Console footer is navigable via just shortcuts.
Using the ‘f’ shortcut, we can select the footer and then navigate it either using the number or the arrow keys.
Drag and Drop Tabs
With the Console, the majority of tabs are transactional ie. Cases, contacts, accounts, assets etc.
However, there are tabs which become user favorites, like certain knowledge articles, daily performance reports, chatter groups etc.
Spring ‘15 allows agents to reorder tabs.
This means that I can open any tab and pull it to the front of the tabs list, organizing in such a way that my favorites are up front.
Provide brief product overview and summarize updates for the new release
Feature Overview
Ctrl-Click to Open Tabs in the Background
Have you tried opening multiple tabs in the Console?
Today, you can only open one tab at a time ie. clicking on a link takes focus to the newly opened tab.
This is frustrating for users who want to quickly open a number of tabs together, and have them loaded when they select the first one.
Now, ctrl-clicking on a tab opens it in the background, and loads it immediately just like a browser.
Users can ctrl click open multiple tabs not losing focus.
Open CTI Method Enhancements
There were 3 enhancements to the Open CTI API –
- person account info is now returned with all APIs that get the record information
- custom labels are returned for standard objects with all APIs that get record information
- Picklist values are returned instead of picklist number with all APIs returning record information
Console Clone Button
As someone who is always showing customers the art of the possible with the Console, I create a number of Console, which are essentially copies of each other with different configurations.
Admins also use different Consoles to test new configs, and to deploy different Consoles to different orgs.
The new clone button on the Console makes creating Console copies, essentially just two clicks.
Provide brief product overview and summarize updates for the new release
Feature Overview
Auto Enable Console Features
The Console has some very useful features that require an admin to enable.
TO improve the experience of end users, we are now enabling the following features for all customers –
- Save User Sessions (remember users workspaces)
- Enable Multi Monitor
(allow pop out of components)
- Enable Keyboard Shortcuts
(allow users to use keyboard shortcuts)
Hide Old Agent Console in New Orgs
The old agent Console product, released in 2006-2007, is no longer receiving active development or investment.
The Salesforce Console is the replacement for the old Agent Console.
This change to hide the Agent Console is only applicable for new orgs at the moment.
New Console Recommended Machine Specifications
The Salesforce Console runs best on modern browsers with high memory configurations.
As such, we are documenting the recommended machine configuration at 8GB of RAM with the Chrome browser.
We know from experience that customers using 4GB of RAM and IE8 will not have a good experience.
We want to be up front with customers regarding this.
Provide brief product overview and summarize updates for the new release
Feature Overview
Responsive Sidebars – Min Width and Height
Key Capabilities:
Collapse sidebars that don’t have space to render gracefully
The minimum width and height features for standard console components ensure that there is at least enough real estate for a component to be usable.
If there isn’t the component simply collapses itself.
When expanded again, it expands to the minimum required real width or height.
Expand
Reduce Width
Collapse/Expand Sidebar:
Keyboard Shortcut And API
Key Capabilities:
Keyboard Shortcut – Collapse sidebars quickly
With Spring ‘15, any sidebar region can be collapsed using the ‘Shift + arrow’ keys.
To apply this at the subtab level, select that level with ‘s’ first.
To apply at the primary tab level, hit ‘p’ first.
Any region can be collapsed using the left, right, top and bottom keys for those respective regions.
Shift + <-
Collapse/Expand Sidebar:
Key Capabilities:
API - Collapse sidebars based on record data
In addition to the key board shortcut, an API allows powerful control of the sidebar regions as well.
With the API, visibility of any region can be controlled based on record data, events etc.
The API is very straightforward -
Case Status = In Progress
Case Status = New

Contextual Details
What details will help internal resources prepare for customer conversations?
{}Feature{}
{}Known Limitations{}
Responsive Sidebars - Min Width and Min Height for Standard Widgets
Only applicable to standard components
Collapse/Expand Sidebars Keyboard Shortcuts and API
Can only act at the sidebar level.
Individual components within a sidebar cannot be collapsed or expanded individually.
Collapse/Expand Pinned List
Zoom Keyboard Shortcut
Keyboard Shortcuts for footer Widgets
Some components like macros capture focus.
In this case the arrow keys will not move to the next component because the focus is on the macro text input box.
Users must press ‘esc’ + ‘f’ to refocus the footer to move to the next one.
The same for navigation with numbers.
Reorder Workspace Tabs
Primary tabs can’t be dragged into subtabs and vice versa.
By design.
Ctrl-Click to open tabs in background
Doesn’t work in the knowledge one component currently.

What you told us:
“There are aspects around Service Reps that we need to consider such as training and business process.
So we would like to pilot the console with one of our service groups.” – {}Sheri Williams and Robert Vickers{}
“Currently in the process of building and designing a console for the Sales users.” – {}Jan Grant{}
“I’ve heard that the difficult part is determining what we want the console to look like.
We should do a quick discovery, pilot with our users, and then iterate on the design.” – {}Scott Smith{}
{}Successful Outcome{}
We’ll work together to define your successful outcome

Chatter enables better collaboration between Service Reps, Supervisors, and even people outside the Service Center for faster case resolution.
Look to expand the use of Chatter in the Service Center and increase it’s adoption.
Provide Chatter ENGAGE and Best Practices

{}Discovery Session Notes{}
12/4/14
Prasad Mandava, Dir SW Dev for Global Support team
worked with Appirio on original deployment
{}Current Layout{}
(See Akamai Console Screen Shots.pptx)
Case page layout very long
too much info on this page
have to always come back to this page to do specific action
Have to scroll down one giant page to do any action
NOT the feed view
{}Page 2 screen shot{}
Feed view
pick up new comments coming in
see same email twice
** because any email from a customer coming in
show as internal or external activity
Email record didn’t have an external flag for in the portal (OUTSIDE SCOPE)
** had to copy data from the email into a task and marking it as external or Internal
Q:
How can we unclutter the feed to hide duplicate emails and other stuff
They have their own portal
Concept of Internal vs. External activities
- Marking these as internal vs. external
Mock-up Overview
1) high level overview
- special instructions; special field for customer
- want top level to be a highlight of the most common parts of the case
> to avoid switching back to the case page to see details
{}Fields{}
Contact & Account info
TSE:
Technical Support Primary (role on the Account team; under the account)
Special Instructions: related list under the account; special instructions for the support team;
Idea here is we can add special instructions for an account
Usually 0-3 notes; or up to 10 notes
Short term Instructions
Some accounts have nothing
**RED Bar on Console screen shot 1
it hogs up the screen; can’t click on it
May be custom button…
2) case ID, Title, Description
F-CS:Akam Case ID
Subject Description
3) see the case team working on this
> ***show this in the feed> show experts?
Case team: related list on the case
Severity: case filed
Visibility: do not show on portal check box field (Unchecked = External)
Product:
Case product
4) Milestone Countdown for initial response
then show what is the next milestone
*** see SDO for this milestone component
Support Levels are mapped to “Initial Response” times
Almost every case has this
5) Tracking the LOE – Actual working time (OUT OF SCOPE)
*** share the AppExchange package
agents felt the stopwatch app was big brother
manually update what rep is doing
*** Jeff to ask what else is available??
Yellow background:
Field Task LOE; calculated filed updated every time you add LOE to the case; running total; users can manually add an Activity with 3 hours; adding up activities associated with the case
6) Scratchpad
working on a case (chrome tabs open; 4 notepads open)
Look at case and see all these tabs
*** whitelisting allowed
*** Does recent tabs save this?
scratchpad - use notepad to free
*** Interaction log??
Tools Tabs:
Too big for a side bar
ALL websites
<hlnk id="rId10" history="1"><rpr id="6">{}www.tools.gss.akamai.com</rpr id="6" transform="close"></hlnk>{}
They will send URLs
*** Q:
Can these URLs be dynamically generated with preformatted URL
Tools links (from Nora):
putty (this is actually a desktop client, not a web application.
We can leave it out for now)
<rpr id="3">eStats  </rpr id="3" transform="close"><hlnk id="rId11" tgtFrame="_blank" history="1"><rpr id="6">{}http://tools.gss.akamai.com/estats/</rpr id="6" transform="close"></hlnk>{}

Here are 2 examples tools link that we would want to try to pull in Account or Case field data:
<rpr id="3">1)      </rpr id="3" transform="close"><hlnk id="rId17" tgtFrame="_blank" history="1"><rpr id="6">{}https://monarch.akamai.com/account/{}1-599K</rpr id="6" transform="close"></hlnk>{}{}
<rpr id="3">2)      </rpr id="3" transform="close"><hlnk id="rId18" tgtFrame="_blank" history="1"><rpr id="6">{}https://control.akamai.com/ui/portal/manage_account.jsp?accountid={}1-599K</rpr id="6" transform="close"></hlnk>{}{}
Where 1-599K is the AKAM Account ID on the associated Account, for example
7) Action oriented steps (Case Lifecycle actions)
Most frequent things they do are under case details
goal is to take most commonly used things front and center
ALERT agent when a next issue comes up
Jackson: this is mapped after the Screen shot 1 and 2
** JD Look up what these are:
Publishers?
Case Transitions
*** Publishers for this
Example:
Initial Response Opens in the feed
but then you can do different Actions:
Log a call; Send an email;
pre-populate the fields with specific actions
*** Would like the side bar to track the steps:
HOW?
> Workflow?
> Milestones?  *** Can use the Milestone
{}JD*** Can Use Entitlements:{}
{}Entitlement processes let you define timelines that include all of the steps (milestones) that your team must complete to resolve cases.{}
{}Each process determines how to enforce the correct service levels for your customers.{}
Nora:
Subtabs – we call that the sessioning; we used to have a desktop app that interacted with old CRM; it allowed users to switch between desktops or browsers
Today they are only using one Milestone:
Initial Response Milestone (IR)
Other groups are using two:
IR and Resolution
- not many clear cut Operation Rules as when to escalate,
Chatter
- Jackson:
Can click follow but it doesn’t seem to do anything
- Chatter is turned on
- *** Vicky:
We want to use it, but we don’t use it nearly enough
- We want to increase adoption to do this
- *** Chatter accelerator
Most agents use Case Detail View
Use Case: would be very powerful for Escalation
{}Case Feed Fixes:{}
Nora need to clean it up
Duplicate items
We expose email in the portal
In Salesforce there is an Email Object
Screen Two
Top email is the case
2{}nd{} email is the Activity; copy of the email; added as an activity; marked as External emails
Solution??? *** Hide it from the feed????
***JD: ???
Use Case Feed Filters as a workaround
***We do have CR (Change Request) to see if you can hide that from the field.
Want to show case activities
Jackson:
I would rather clean up this process
Duplicate emails; For every email, it creates a duplicate task
Integration with Portal process
Read vs. Unread flag on email activities; What is this how does it work?
Running report on activity object
It was showing a Field as Read and unread
Jack IDEAs
Push notifications for Console
- can set on fields that exist
- Milestone status; field change
Roadmap
- WorkTask pop ups (???) use this as future roadmap
CTI?
- Avaya
- Move over to Open CTI (currently testing)
- CTI Toolkit is difficult to install; not used by many agents
Jyotsna
- Access
- Desired Console

Action oriented steps (Case Lifecycle actions)
Most frequent things they do are under case details
Goal is to move most commonly used things front and center
ALERT agent when a next issue comes up
Case Transitions from one stage to the next
Example:
Initial Response Opens in the feed
But then you can do different Actions:
Log a call; Send an email;
Pre-populate the fields with specific data and next steps
Use side panel components to bring commonly used Case Detail Page data to the top of the page.
Use a Case Feed Actions to create common steps to resole cases

Requirement to Post a Draft Social post in one action (for the managers)
The reps do not have the social post action
*** Check to see how to do a Social post option
Karen: no way to prevent Reps from
Part of the Social Post managed package
Karen talking to Radian 6, Product Managers, and no way around this
*** Extensive conversations and this is not solvable
Reps do not have Chatter permission
Because it would allow agents to Post a Social profile
Chatter is not Activated for Social Post actions
Use Case for reps
See Case object
See social persona
Not need the feed view; just the case detail view
No way to lock down the chatter post

Tshinina Gear - “Nina”; Manager of the team that is using the social servicing;
* Karen will ask Nina to invite a rep
Corporate Org - B2B
Retail Org
- Older instance
- Not Globally enabled chatter for the Org
- Recently did Social Hub roll out
- Limitations with oversight
- reps using standard list view
Managers using social posting; with a Console; and Case Feed
- Console setup a few weeks ago
- Enabled Dual monitors
- Setup basic Console
- Reps don’t have a console
- Did not spend time doing usability of the console
GOAL
- Create a console for Reps
- Reps have to have a manager approve the post before it can be posted
** So not able to give Reps the Social post actions
- Took the whole feature away from Reps profile
- Went to the extreme of taking away ALL permissions to show it can be done
TWO separate consoles
-
*** list view is not visible in mngr console
- No Social Publisher Action for Reps
Reps also do some other case management
- They also do Social Posts; limited
Rep Social Post Process
- Case list view
- Social Hub places into queue
- create text field on case page layout
- type in reply
- goes to Mngr and they reply; cut and paste into social post Action
- OR reject and ask to re-write
- ** No way to write a draft in chatter
- IDEA: use Macros to copy and paste into the action
- ** Really excited about Dual Monitor
*** Q:
Can you assign the console via a Permission Set?
A:
I don’t know
Karen - yes I think you can

What you told us:
“Reps cannot use the case feed in the console, because they are not allowed to make a social post.
You cannot turn this feature off in the Social Hub.” – {}Karen{}

“Can Agents use the Quick Text feature to populate the Social Post Draft Reply?” – {}Nina{}
“Can we display Quick Text in the sidebar?” – {}Karen{}
{}Successful Outcome{}
We’ll work together to define your successful outcome
Create a Console for the Service Reps that process Social Hub Cases.
Include functionality to assist with other Case types handled by the reps.

What we learned from our Discovery call
1
Reps need to use the console without case feed
Reps not allowed to create social post responses
Need to be approved and posted by a manager
Chatter enables better collaboration between Service Reps, Supervisors, and even people outside the Service Center for faster case resolution.
The current Social Hub process does not allow the ability to block Reps from posting, therefore Case Feed cannot be usee at this time.
When possible in the future, look to expand the use of Chatter in the Service Center and increase it’s adoption.
Provide Chatter ENGAGE and Best Practices
2
Social Post URLs open in a new browser Tab or Window, not in the Console Subtab
It would be great if the URL opened in the Subtab so the reps can keep the posts associated with the Primary Tab Case.
Custom footer that can be used to open the Post URL; Reps could use this with Multi Monitor feature (Karen’s idea)
Lisa Clapham provided this as a potential workaround: <kern val="1200"><fill-sd val="&lt;a:solidFill&gt;&lt;a:schemeClr val=&quot;dk1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a:solidFill&gt;"><font latin="&lt;latin val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:latin typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-lt&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" ea="&lt;ea val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:ea typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-ea&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;" cs="&lt;cs val=&quot;&amp;lt;a:cs typeface=&amp;quot;+mn-cs&amp;quot;/&gt;&quot;&gt;"><lnk-c val="&lt;a:hlinkClick r:id=&quot;rId3&quot;/&gt;">{}http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api_console/Content/sforce_api_console_opensubtab.htm</lnk-c></font></fill-sd></kern>{}

Quick Text for Reps
Can Agents use the Quick Text feature to populate the Social Post Draft Reply?
Can we display Quick Text in the sidebar?
Using this feature will allow the agents to create draft post replies more efficiently and more consistently.
Quick Text feature can only be used in the Case Feed.
Create a Visual Force Custom component to list the Quick Text in the right side panel

Console Notes
{}Service Cloud Console Design{}
{}Learning Activity Instructions{}
The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate that you have practical hands-on experience with creating and configuring a Salesforce Console for Service Cloud.
You will be asked to review two customer scenarios and prepare a mock presentation to demo your solutions.
The two scenarios are:
1) Build a Service Console based on the requirements provided by Customer #1 below.
2) Review an existing Service Console used by Customer #2 and make recommendations on how to improve it.
{}Scenario #1:{}
Assume the VP of Service at NetWorks. has inquired about this accelerator.
This consumer home networking products company has recently acquired a new company, PowerWorks, and successfully merged the two Technical Support teams using the same Org and Case management processes.
They are now ready to improve agent efficiency and want to create a Console so that they can pilot it with a small group of Level 1 Agents in their Austin, TX service center.
Cases are generated via phone, email, and web form.
See this link for the sample Discussion Document questionnaire with the customer’s requirements: <hlnk id="rId7"><rpr id="3">{}https://org62.my.salesforce.com/069300000051mmE</rpr id="3" transform="close"></hlnk>{}
{}Scenario #2:{}
This customer has been using a Salesforce Console for about 18 months.
They have not been keeping up with the latest releases and would like an evaluation of their current design.
The Business Analyst team has created a wireframe for a “Dream” console layout and would like recommendations on how to implement the design.
Keep in mind that the Business Analyst team is familiar with how the agents resolve cases in their current console design, but they are not Salesforce Administrators and do not understand the full capabilities of the Console.
You need to make recommendations about what can be accomplished declaratively “out-of-the-box” and what would require development or integration.
See this link for the sample wireframe: <hlnk id="rId8"><rpr id="3">{}https://org62.my.salesforce.com/069300000051mmJ</rpr id="3" transform="close"></hlnk>{}
{}Your Assignment:{}

Console for Service Design
Upon certification, deliverers of this accelerator should be able to:
- Qualify viable candidates for the Console for Service Accelerator
- Demonstrate the ability to configure a Salesforce Console from scratch
- Demonstrate the ability to reconfigure an existing Salesforce Console
- Demonstrate knowledge of custom vs. out-of-the-box Console features
This accelerator targets those customers that need help creating and configuring the Salesforce Console for their service agents.
We will provide deployment guidance and best practices.
The customer will deploy console to agents.

Prior to Session
- Ensure the correct stakeholders are invited to the discovery call
- Service (Manager, Supervisor, Agent)
- IT (Sys Admin)
- Obtain Sys Admin access to the Sandbox org
- Ensure that any required data/record population is completed before discovery
- Be sure to ask if the Sandbox is in a production stream
- Review customer’s current Console design if available; ask CSG / Account team about any progress to date - for example:
- Console deployed 2 years ago
- Console configured but never deployed to users
Review Discovery Questionnaire before the session
During the Session
- Ask open-ended questions about the customer’s Service Processes
- Refine draft Successful Outcome that was created during the FCD session
- Probe for more information and thorough understanding of their challenges
After the Discovery Session and as you progress through the Build/Design Review phase:
- Update the Discovery document with notes and decisions
- Create and update the Discussion Document
Key speak points to be reinforced with this accelerator:
1.
Start with a review of the draft Successful Outcome discussed during the First Call Deck review
- This will be finalized by the end of the session
2.
Provide a quick overview of Salesforce Console capabilities using:
- A deck with configuration examples and customer examples
(see Additional Assets at the end)
- Provide a demo with an SDO
3.
Follow the discussion guide to drill into the common use cases for customer service.
- What are the key pieces of information that service agents need to solve cases?
- What capabilities fall outside this accelerator?
At the end of the session, finalize the Successful Outcome based on what was discovered.
Schedule Next Steps
- This may be a series of Agile like Build/Design Review sessions with key personnel
- Don’t start from scratch; clone existing Consoles; modify existing Page Layouts.
- Examine existing Consoles or failed Console designs; Understand the nuances of previous failed designs.
- Have an experienced service rep demo a few common use cases within their Org.
- It’s OK to have a few Build/Review cycles to zero in on the best layout.
- Identify and call out any areas that are Out of Scope.
- Be sure IT (Sys Admin) is engaged throughout.
Hold an IT Hand-Off meeting if needed.
- Uncover Sys Admin knowledge gaps and what did they struggle with in the past.
- Record your sessions.
They will help you and customers usually ask for them as well, especially the final Discussion Session.
